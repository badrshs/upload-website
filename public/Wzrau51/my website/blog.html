i have 5 reasnos why i love making programming my career
(1)I like building things people use. It's amazing to type up some code, press a button, and suddenly thousands of people on the Internet are playing with it.
(2)I like research. Programming tends to involve much googling and reading through documentation
(3)I like experimenting. There's a large component of trial-and-error.
(4)I like communicating. Most good programmers will tell you that code is first-and-foremost meant to be read by people -- even to the extent that we'll sometimes write it in a way that is inefficient but easy-to-read.
(5)I like learning. Like sharks, programmers die if they stop moving. Because technology changes so fast, being a programmer means that "school" never stops. Even though I've been coding for years, I must constantly read programming books, follow blogs, and so on. There's no coasting.
