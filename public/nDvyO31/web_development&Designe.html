           <h3>What Are HTML & CSS?</h3>
            <p>HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.</p><br>

 <p>The two languages—HTML and CSS—are independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.<br>

With this understanding of the difference between HTML and CSS, let’s dive into HTML in more detail.</p>
