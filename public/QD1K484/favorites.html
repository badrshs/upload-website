<p><h2 font-family:Arial Rounded MT Bold;style="color:rgb(134, 45, 134)";font-size="35"
I have many diffrent type of hobbies and on this slide i will tell you all about them .
<br/>
My first hobby that i probably like the most is rock climbing even though I am still a
<br/>
beginner I still just love climbing all the way up and looking down on everyone .
<br/>
Another hobby that I like to do is biking and that is because I love the wind in my hair
<br/>
and speeding past everyone. One of the last of my hobbies is swimming although I don't like 
<br/>
racing I just love to do flips in the water and pretend I am a fish. So those have been my 
<br/>
hobbies and if you haven't tries them yet they are probably the best thing in the world 
<br/>
that is fun and it helps get you in shape.
