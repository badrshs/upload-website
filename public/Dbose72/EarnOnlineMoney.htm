            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>First of all let me clear one thing. 
            On the internet, the only way to make money is via doing one or 
            another kind of a job. Without work, no one can make any money. 
            Money is not for free. That is; no person or site will give away 
            money to other people for free. Why will any body do that? 
            <BR><BR>People on the internet can make legitimate money if they 
            choose the right way. Do not look for online money making 
            opportunities where you are suppose to be paid for doing no work. In 
            order to make money, you will need to do an online job. 
            <BR><BR>There are many legitimate cash making opportunities on the 
            internet and on the other hand, there are many scams too. So the 
            simplest formula to avoid online money scams is to not pay any thing 
            from your pocket to any one. This also includes not giving any 
            personal information like your credit card info. <BR><BR>The 
            legitimate way to make money online is via doing jobs at freelancing 
            sites. Freelancing sites are like a market place where buyers post 
            different kinds of jobs and job seekers place bids on these 
            projects. The buyer chooses one or more winners among all bidders. 
            This is how freelancing sites work. <BR><BR>There are two types of 
            freelancing sites. One is where you can join and work for free. That 
            is, you can place bids on projects without paying any membership 
            fee. But when you won a project and you get paid after the 
            completion of the project; the site charge a small fee. Dont worry; 
            you dont have to pay this fee from your pocket. <BR><BR>This fee 
            will be deducted from the money you will earn at the freelance 
            sties. For example; if you won a project worth $300, and complete it 
            in the given time period. After that, the buyer will pay you the 
            $300 and you will be able to see the money in the freelance sites 
            account. <BR><BR>But instead of $300, you will get something like 
            $285 after the site charge their fees. The other type of freelance 
            site is where you need to pay a membership fee before you can start 
            bidding on projects. I suggest you only work at free freelance 
            sites.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Taking Online Surveys</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>When trying to earn money taking 
            online surveys, you need to know how and what to do in order to make 
            money taking these surveys. There is a lot of misinformation that is 
            spread about earning money in this fashion. <BR><BR>Knowing the 
            information about how to earn money taking online surveys is the key 
            to making a living taking these surveys. With all the misinformation 
            that swarms about these surveys, you need to be able to know the 
            truth of the matter in order to find the most profitable way for you 
            to go about making intelligent choices for finding the survey site 
            that is right for you. <BR><BR><B>Find Out More About The Site In 
            Question</B> <BR><BR>One of the things that you first need to do 
            when deciding to earn money taking online surveys is to examine your 
            options. There are many different sites for surveys and sites that 
            have you to pay them to find the most profitable. Which one do you 
            choose? And how do you know that you have made the right choice? 
            Generally speaking, those who ask you to pay for a membership are of 
            two kinds, rip off and legitimate. Here is where detective work 
            comes in handy. When looking at a site, compare everything and 
            decide if this site is really for you. <BR><BR><B>What Is Their 
            Rewards Program?</B> <BR><BR>The rewards programs of most online 
            survey companies vary from points and gift cards to cold hard cash. 
            You can earn money taking online surveys, but you will need to 
            decide if you want the rewards program, or the cold hard cash. If 
            you are trying to make a living, the cold hard cash is the best 
            option for you. When checking into these programs, look at the 
            amount that is paid per completed survey. This will be your deciding 
            factor. <BR><BR><B>How Reliable are They With Payment?</B> 
            <BR><BR>Earn money taking online surveys is a fun way to get some 
            extra cash. Bear in mind that some restrictions will be placed on 
            levels of payments and the levels which payment will be make to you 
            and how the payment will be made to you. Various sites only pay in 
            gift cards or other types of prizes, so you will need to decide on 
            what site that you want to approach and find out exactly what their 
            payment system is. Some payment systems use checks, others use 
            PayPal and still others reward with gift cards. Check and see from 
            other people just how reliable their payment system is. 
            <BR><BR><B>What Types of Surveys Do They Have? What Frequency Can 
            You Expect?</B> <BR><BR>When trying to earn money taking online 
            surveys, you also will need to know what types of surveys do they 
            have and how frequently will they send them out to you? Some only 
            send once a month, while others send out more frequently. Usually 
            when you sign up with one of these companies, you will take a survey 
            that will show them your tastes and likes. You should receive 
            surveys based on that, but sometimes they will send you a survey 
            that you don&#8217;t expect.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Tips</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt><B>1.</B> Flipping Websites - Also 
            called as Virtual Real Estate. You buy websites that are being sold 
            at a cheaper price and revamp the site to maximize its potential. 
            The main goal here to work on improving the site and then sell it 
            for a quick cash. <BR><BR><B>2.</B> Squidoo Lenses - Creating lenses 
            or pages at squidoo is fairly easy and should take about 30 minutes 
            or so. After that, you simply start adding and promoting your 
            affiliate products. Since Squidoo lenses rank higher in google, it 
            brings in more traffic and more chances for people to purchase items 
            using your squidoo pages. <BR><BR><B>3.</B> Image Hosting Site - 
            Bandwidths are getting cheaper these days.. so you can just set-up 
            an image hosting site. Lots of people would want most of their 
            images hosted on other servers (think myspace images being used on 
            commenting) .. high traffic would do wonders on CPM ads. 
            <BR><BR><B>4.</B> Get Paid to Blog- Try Smorty-Get Paid to Blog or 
            similar programs. You do not need to promote anything or wait for 
            anyone to click on any link for you to earn something. Once your 
            post has been approved, you get paid right away. <BR><BR><B>5.</B> 
            Sell links at Tnx.Net - take advantage of your high ranking PR site 
            or your average rate of site visitors by selling text links on your 
            site. This is a good opportunity for publishers to monetize their 
            sites and for advertisers to drive more traffic to their sites, as 
            well as improving search engine listings. <BR><BR><B>6.</B> Blog 
            Network - Most of us already have about more than 5 blogs at the 
            moment.. but did you know that this is also a good way to earn money 
            online by selling text links on your blog network? There are 
            registrars that gives a huge discount when buying bulk domains plus 
            everything can be done automatically when you use a script. 
            <BR><BR><B>7.</B> Proxy Sites - no maintenance needed. The simpler 
            the lay-out the better.. just make sure you do get to blend your ads 
            well. Most Schools and workplaces don&#8217;t allow leisure internet 
            surfing anymore thus there is a continuous demand for new proxies 
            each day. <BR><BR><B>8.</B> YouTube Videos - Make a channel related 
            to your sites content then upload YouTube video units with embedded 
            Google adsense ads. <BR><BR><B>9.</B> Advertising on your Site - 
            Earn extra by looking for advertisers on your site. Look for 
            advertisers who have the same niche as yours as they would most 
            likely be willing to gain extra exposure this way. 
            <BR><BR><B>10.</B> Sponsored Reviews - All you have to do is to 
            write reviews about products and services being offered to the 
            public. Most companies are taking this route since this would 
            greatly leverage targeted traffic.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Great Way to Earn Money</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>AdSense is an advertising program run 
            by Google. It is a revolutionary method to earn from a websites 
            traffic. AdSense is considered as one of the most powerful tool in a 
            website publishers arsenal. Googlr AdSense has been particularly 
            important for delivering advertising revenue to small websites that 
            do not have the resources for developing advertising sales programs 
            and salespeople. <BR><BR>Many sites use AdSense to monetize their 
            content and some webmasters work hard to maximize their own AdSense 
            income. Adsense revenue is generated when a visitor to your site 
            clicks through an Adsense Ad you have displayed. When the user 
            clicks the image, he or she is redirected to the advertisers website 
            in the same way as regular AdSense advertisements. <BR><BR>The 
            source of all AdSense income is the AdWords program which in turn 
            has a complex pricing model based on a Vickrey second price auction, 
            in that it commands an advertiser to submit a sealed bid (not 
            observable by competitors). Combine AdSense with affiliate products, 
            maybe selling a couple of your own products and paid blogging gigs, 
            and yea, $500-$1k per week is possible. <BR><BR><B>Website 
            Content</B> <BR><BR>Google AdSense for Mobile unlocks the potential 
            of the mobile advertising market. As part of our ongoing efforts to 
            develop new ways for users to find the information they need anytime 
            and anywhere, Google announced today the availability of AdSense for 
            Mobile, a program that contextually targets ads to mobile website 
            content. Like its traditional AdSense program this will contextually 
            targets ads to mobile wensite content. The system automatically 
            reviews the content of publishers&#8217; mobile websites and delivers text 
            ads that are relevant to the websites&#8217; audience and content. "With 
            this program, advertisers can connect with the growing number of 
            mobile publishers, ultimately providing users with an enhanced 
            mobile experience that helps them find what they are looking for 
            more quickly and efficiently on the go," said Google, as it 
            yesterday announced AdSense for Mobile, a program that contextually 
            targets ads to mobile website content. <BR><BR><B>Google Adsense For 
            Mobile</B> <BR><BR>Google says that AdSence for mobile is intended 
            for AdSense partners who have created websites specifically for 
            mobile browsers, and who want to monetise their mobile content via 
            contextual advertising. AdSense for Mobile is identical to AdSense 
            for Web sites, which places ads on participating publishers sites 
            that correspond to the publishers content. Google Adsense for Mobile 
            is ultimate way to make money because this is a new product so there 
            is less competition. However, adsense for mobile is only out to 
            certain selected publishers so far for their mobile platform 
            optimized sites. <BR><BR>AdSense for Mobile gives the ability to 
            AdSense publishing partners to earn revenue from their mobile 
            websites through the targeted placement of mobile text ads. AdSense 
            for Mobile provides a valuable way to connect mobile users with the 
            right ad at the right time as they seek information on the go. 
            Adsense Mobile text ads run on an auction model, in the same fashion 
            to regular Adsense/ Adwords ads are offered. <BR><BR>"When you add 
            the new AdSense for mobile code to your site," explained Alex Kenin, 
            Product Marketing Manager for AdSense for Mobile, "well display 
            relevant ads using the same targeting technology that you are 
            familiar with for existing AdSense products. With that, Google is 
            giving Adsense a free reign allowing AdSense publishing partners the 
            ability to earn revenue from their mobile websites through the 
            targeted placement of mobile text ads. <BR><BR><B>Conclusion</B> 
            <BR><BR>Mobile advertising tiny, but a potential goldmine. In fact, 
            there are currently more mobile devices worldwide than personal 
            computers and televisions combined. Mobile browser development is 
            now bounding ahead. AdSense for Mobile is intended for AdSense 
            partners who have created websites specifically for mobile browsers, 
            and who want to monetize their mobile content via contextual 
            advertising. AdSense for Mobile also allows AdSense publishing 
            partners the ability to earn revenue from their mobile websites 
            through the targeted placement of mobile text ads. Now, with the 
            formal launch of AdSense for Mobile, Google seems to be getting into 
            the transportability trend.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            href="./2.htm">Google Adwords - Using 
            Adwords To Make Money</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>You have an option to start making 
            money online through someone else&#8217;s products. This manner of online 
            money making is referred to as affiliate marketing, and by joining 
            an affiliate program you would be capable of earning a commission of 
            each sale you make. Although this sounds rather easy, in the initial 
            stages you will need time, patience and a small amount of money. 
            <BR><BR>The first step is to register with an online affiliate 
            program. There is a variety for you to choose from; however a 
            particular well known one and the one I have first hand knowledge of 
            is called Clickbank. Once you have reached the home page and signed 
            up to Clickbank, you will need to go to the marketplace to check out 
            the range of products that you could attach yourself to. Clickbank 
            uses a technique where the products with a higher chance of making 
            money are placed at the top of the listing. Some determining factors 
            of the product placement include sales trends and how often a click 
            is converted into a sale. <BR><BR>The optimum product to sell is the 
            one with high sales opposed to high commission. An even better 
            option if you can find a product like this; high sales and high 
            commission! When you have chosen your product, you need to click on 
            the &#8216;hoplink&#8217;. This will inform you of your affiliate link, which 
            you will need to copy and save for advertising purposes. 
            <BR><BR>Having an affiliate site is not going to make you money if 
            you don&#8217;t advertise it. This next section will introduce you to 
            advertising using Google Adwords. Google Adwords is a pay-per-click 
            advertising program, and it can be accessed through the main Google 
            search page. You will need to register with this program and it is 
            very important that you read the editorial guidelines thoroughly. 
            This will prevent you from having to redo ads with factors that 
            Google prohibits. Once you have enrolled, you can start making your 
            small advertisement which will be shown in Google search results. 
            The advertisement needs to be attention-grabbing so as to lure 
            potential buyers to it. Most importantly your ad must have relevant 
            keywords in it. After all, the search is based on keywords. 
            <BR><BR>This is where you can send yourself broke if you&#8217;re not 
            careful! You have to choose the keywords that will relate to your 
            advertisement and therefore your site. Once you have chosen your 
            keywords, Google will inform you of a price per click. You either 
            accept this information and begin your advertising or delete it and 
            try again. In the event that you accept and plan to start 
            advertising, you need to decide on a budget. I recommend that you 
            place a daily limit on your campaigns, because without one you will 
            find that your invoice balance grows VERY quickly. A small amount 
            per day will allow you to find a product that makes money for you, 
            and then you might decide to increase your budget slightly for a 
            time. You have to consider your budget while paying enough money to 
            allow your ad to be in the first couple pages of the search listing. 
            Once all this is done, you are required to finalize your account set 
            up by notifying Google of your credit card details. Your Google 
            account will be settled each month through this credit card. The 
            good news is that your commission will be deposited into your click 
            bank account after each sale. That is how to make money with 
            affiliate programs and that is how you will build your bank 
            balance.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            programs for your niche. You must choose the most rewarding, 
            reliable and successful affiliate programs. The merchant must also 
            supply you some marketing tools you can use to promote the products. 
            The affiliate program or products must also be of high quality and 
            must be well-priced. This will make is easy for you to sell them 
            products or programs. <BR><BR>3. Build a web site focused on your 
            niche, and have high quality and unique content that is rich with 
            your key words and phrases. <BR><BR>4. Have a budget for promoting 
            your website. <BR><BR>5. Drive traffic to your website. Your website 
            will need traffic for you to earn affiliate commissions. Write 
            articles, submit online press releases related to your niche and 
            submit your website to search engines. You can also exchange links 
            with high ranking websites related to your niche. <BR><BR>6. Review 
            your affiliate programs or products on a blog, and include your 
            affiliate links. <BR><BR>7. Build an email list and offer free 
            e-courses, articles or e-books. When you have a list, you can keep 
            in regular contact with your prospects and recommend your affiliate 
            products to them. <BR><BR>8. Be available to answer any questions 
            from your prospects and customers. Customer relationship management 
            is very important in online business. Make sure that you provide 
            your real name and an email address on your website so that 
            potential customers can contact you with questions, and know there 
            is a real person behind that website. This is important for your 
            credibility. <BR><BR>9. Build your own network of sub-affiliates. 
            Keep in touch with your sub-affiliates and motivate them to succeed 
            because their success is your success too. <BR><BR>10. Work hard 
            consistently in promoting your website and have
