            Tips to Help You Through the Citizenship Process</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>So you have finally made the decision 
            to take the step of becoming a US citizen. You have made a smart 
            choice to become a citizen of one of the greatest countries in the 
            world. A word of warning though, going through the citizenship 
            process is not as simple and straightforward as you may think. 
            <BR><BR>It was with this in mind, I decided to write this article, 
            to provide you with some tips to help you through the citizenship 
            process and ultimately reach your goal of becoming a US citizen. 
            <BR><BR>Firstly you need to get, fill out and submit form N-400, you 
            can do this online or via mail, you need to make sure you submit 
            your form to your local government office. <BR><BR>Once your N-400 
            form has been reviewed, and provided there are no major issues, you 
            will then be invited to attend an interview. In the interview you 
            will be asked a whole range of things from why you think you deserve 
            to become a US citizen, questions about the history of the united 
            stated as well as opinions and beliefs on a variety of subjects. 
            <BR><BR>Whatever you do, dont panic during the interview process, 
            just be yourself and answer the questions as truthfully and 
            heartfelt as you can. The people conducting the interview are very 
            well trained and will soon know if you being dishonest, but for the 
            most part they are there to help you become a US citizen. 
            <BR><BR>While this is far from an exhaustive guide on the steps to 
            gain citizenship, it does contain some tips to get you started on 
            your journey to becoming a US Citizen.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            the United Kingdom</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Immigration to the United Kingdom, 
            Immigration to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
            Ireland since 1922, has been substantial, in particular from Ireland 
            and the former colonies of the British Empire - such as India, 
            Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Caribbean, South Africa, Kenya and Hong 
            Kong - under British nationality law. Others have come as asylum 
            seekers, seeking protection as refugees under the United Nations 
            1951 Refugee Convention, or from European Union (EU) member states, 
            exercising one of the EUs Four Freedoms. <BR><BR>About half the 
            population increase between the 1991 and 2001 censuses was due to 
            foreign-born immigration. 4.9 million People (8.3 percent of the 
            population at the time) were born abroad, although the census gives 
            no indication of their immigration status or intended length of 
            stay. <BR><BR>In 2006, there were 149,035 applications for British 
            citizenship, 32 percent fewer than in 2005. The number of people 
            granted citizenship during 2006 was 154,095, 5 per cent fewer than 
            in 2005. The largest groups of people granted British citizenship 
            were from India, Pakistan, Somalia and the Philippines. In 2006, 
            134,430 people were granted settlement in the UK, a drop of 25 per 
            cent on 2005.Meanwhile, migration from Central and Eastern Europe 
            has increased since 2004 with the accession to the European Union of 
            eight Central and Eastern European states, since there is free 
            movement of labour within the EU. The UK government is currently 
            phasing in a new points-based immigration system for people from 
            outside of the European Economic Area. <BR><BR>Until the 
            Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, all Commonwealth citizens could 
            enter and stay in the United Kingdom without any restriction. The 
            Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 made Citizens of the United Kingdom 
            and Colonies (CUKCs) whose passports were not directly issued by the 
            United Kingdom Government (i.e. passports issued by the Governor of 
            a colony or by the Commander of a British protectorate) subject to 
            immigration control. <BR><BR>Indians began arriving in the UK in 
            large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 
            1947. More than 60,000 arrived before 1955, many of whom drove 
            buses, or worked in foundries or textile factories. Later arrivals 
            opened corner shops or ran post offices. The flow of Indian 
            immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by 
            Idi Amins sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from 
            Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK. <BR><BR>By 
            1972, only holders of work permits, or people with parents or 
            grandparents born in the UK could gain entry - effectively stemming 
            primary immigration from Commonwealth countries. <BR><BR>Following 
            the end of World War II, substantial groups of people from 
            Soviet-controlled territories settled in Britain, particularly Poles 
            and Ukrainians. The UK recruited displaced people as so-called 
            European Volunteer Workers in order to provide labour to industries 
            that were required in order to aim economic recovery after the war. 
            In the 1951 census, the Polish-born population of the UK numbered 
            some 162,339, up from 44,642 in 1931. <BR><BR>There was also an 
            influx of refugees from Hungary, following the crushing of the 1956 
            Hungarian revolution, numbering 20,990. <BR><BR>The British 
            Nationality Act 1981, which was enacted in 1983, distinguishes 
            between British citizen or British Overseas Territories citizen. The 
            former hold nationality by descent and the latter hold nationality 
            other than by descent. Citizens by descent cannot automatically pass 
            on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or 
            it&#8217;s Overseas Territories (though in some situations the child can 
            be registered as a citizen). <BR><BR>Immigration officers have to be 
            satisfied about a persons nationality and identity and entry could 
            be refused if they were not satisfied.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>
