          <TD colSpan=3>Are you planning to start a business in Dubai, doing 
            an exhibition? Or looking for new business opportunities in Dubai? 
            Then I urge you to read every single word in this page. 
            <BR><BR>Business is the main focus of Dubai economy. Often, the 
            government is encouraging and creating new business opportunities in 
            Dubai. However, Dubai business set-up is not easy. <BR><BR>You MUST 
            know each and every step of setting up a business in Dubai, unless 
            you get a professional company to do this for you. Don't worry. I 
            will show you how to set-up a business in Dubai. Also you can fill 
            the form at the bottom of this page to get the best business set-up 
            company in Dubai to do all tasks for you (more info at the bottom). 
            <BR><BR><B>Common requirements to start a Dubai business</B> 
            <BR><BR>Every business in Dubai needs a &#8220;sponsor&#8221; except if you want 
            to open a business in a freezone in Dubai. Usually, to open a 
            business in a Dubai freezone requires a big capital. It is not a 
            place for small businesses. The sponsor MUST be a UAE national. A 
            strong sponsor with lot of contacts and influence can be very useful 
            for the business to start and run. Why? You will see many reasons 
            throughout this page. <BR><BR>You have to pay an ongoing fee to the 
            sponsor. There is a big chance that the sponsor may demand a 
            percentage of the profit in addition to the fee. <BR><BR>Once you 
            have acquired a sponsor, you have to register your business and 
            obtain the Trade License. There are different rules for different 
            business types. <BR><BR>For an example, there are specific hygiene 
            related rules to start and run a restaurant. It is not very easy to 
            register a business in Dubai. You may have to seek your sponsor&#8217;s 
            help to get your business registered. Language is a major barrier 
            when dealing with government employees. Otherwise there is a big 
            chance that the application will be rejected. <BR><BR><B>Operating a 
            business in Dubai</B> <BR><BR>Arabic is the common language used in 
            all government offices. Therefore every company has to have an 
            Arabic speaking employee or higher someone temporary to deal with 
            government institutions for various business matters. This is a 
            MUST. <BR><BR>The other important thing is the working visa for 
            employees. This is not easy and your sponsor&#8217;s influence is very 
            important in this matter. If you are planning to run a large-scale 
            business then you have to maintain a percentage of UAE employees. 
            Remember, you have to pay more than double to UAE nationals. 
            <BR><BR>There is no tax in Dubai. However, there are different fees 
            depending on type of the business. <BR><BR><B>What are good Dubai 
            business opportunities?</B> <BR><BR>Well, there are many. But a good 
            business opportunity in Dubai is always not the one bringing more 
            money. <BR><BR>It has to be easy to operate from government rules 
            perspective. Here is my review of good business opportunities in 
            Dubai. <BR><BR>Real Estate &#8211; I think there is still a market in this 
            booming business in Dubai. Dubai real estate investment is not yet 
            very popular internationally. So there is still a market. Travel 
            Packages &#8211; Emirates Airlines and few travel agents handle Most of 
            the travel packages. I think there is a market for a business that 
            is more focused on inbound tourists and travel packages. 
            <BR><BR><B>Online Auctions &#8211; Not much available in Dubai.</B> 
            <BR><BR>Exports &#8211; Some food items like Dates are very cheap in 
            Dubai. Also used cars and jewellery are very cheap in Dubai. 
            <BR><BR>Nightclubs &#8211; There is always a market in Dubai for 
            nightclubs. <BR><BR>Multi Level Marketing &#8211; Dubai has tough laws for 
            pyramid schemes. If you can get the government approval for a 
            genuine MLM then the sky is the limit. <BR><BR>Job agencies for 
            skilled labours &#8211; Almost all job agencies in Dubai are focusing on 
            jobs for professionals. This is a niche business opportunity in 
            Dubai. <BR><BR>Franchise businesses&#8211; This concept is new to Dubai 
            and I am sure there is a huge market for franchises. 
            <BR><BR>Childcare business &#8211; One of the burning issues especially 
            young working couples in Dubai is lack of childcare facilities. This 
            is also a niche business opportunity in Dubai for someone who wants 
            to start a business in Dubai. <BR><BR>You cannot ignore banks when 
            talking about business. Visit Dubai banks page to read about major 
            banks in Dubai. Also visit major companies in Dubai page to read 
            about leading companies in Dubai. <BR><BR><B>The easiest way to 
            set-up a business in Dubai</B> <BR><BR>The easiest way to start a 
            Dubai business is to get a professional consulting company to do all 
            tasks for you. In this way you can ensure that you are not wasting 
            your money. I managed to convince one of the best companies in Dubai 
            to evaluate requirements of visitors of this website and do 
            everything for you for a discounted price.</TD></TR>
