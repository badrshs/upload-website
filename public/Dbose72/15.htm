          <TD colSpan=3>William H. Gates is chairperson and chief software 
            architect of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide leader in software 
            services and Internet technologies for personal and business 
            computing. <BR><BR>Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955 in a 
            family having rich business, political and community service 
            background. His great-grandfather was a state legislator and a 
            mayor, his grandfather was vice president of national bank and his 
            father was a lawyer. <BR><BR>Bill strongly believes in hard work. He 
            believes that if you are intelligent and know how to apply your 
            intelligence, you can achieve anything. From childhood Bill was 
            ambitious, intelligent and competitive. These qualities helped him 
            to attain top position in the profession he chose. In school, he had 
            an excellent record in mathematics and science. Still he was getting 
            very bored in school and his parents knew it, so they always tried 
            to feed him with more information to keep him busy. Bill&#8217;s parents 
            came to know their sons intelligence and decided to enroll him in a 
            private school, known for its intense academic environment. It was a 
            very important decision in Bill Gates life where he was first 
            introduced to a computer. <BR><BR>Bill Gates and his friends were 
            very much interested in computer and formed "Programmers Group" in 
            late 1968. Being in this group, they found a new way to apply their 
            computer skill in university of Washington. In the next year, they 
            got their first opportunity in Information Sciences Inc. in which 
            they were selected as programmers. ISI (Information Sciences Inc.) 
            agreed to give them royalties whenever it made money from any of the 
            group&#8217;s program. As a result of the business deal signed with 
            Information Sciences Inc., the group also became a legal business. 
            <BR><BR>Bill Gates and his close friend Allen started new company of 
            their own, Traf-O-Data. They developed a small computer to measure 
            traffic flow. From this project they earned around $20,000. The era 
            of Traf-O-Data came to an end when Gates left the college. In 1973, 
            he left home for Harvard University. He didn&#8217;t know what to do, so 
            he enrolled his name for pre-law. He took the standard freshman 
            courses with the exception of signing up for one of Harvards 
            toughest mathematics courses. He did well over there, but he 
            couldn&#8217;t find it interesting too. He spent many long nights in front 
            of the schools computer and the next day asleep in class. 
            <BR><BR>After leaving school, he almost lost himself from the world 
            of computers. Gates and his friend Paul Allen remained in close 
            contact even though they were away from school. They would often 
            discuss new ideas for future projects and the possibility of 
            starting a business one fine day. At the end of Bills first year, 
            Allen came close to him so that they could follow some of their 
            ideas. That summer they got job in Honeywell. Allen kept on pushing 
            Bill for opening a new software company. <BR><BR>Within a year, Bill 
            Gates dropped out from Harvard. Then he formed Microsoft. Microsofts 
            vision is "A computer on every desk and Microsoft software on every 
            computer". Bill is a visionary person and works very hard to achieve 
            his vision. His belief in high intelligence and hard work has put 
            him where he is today. He does not believe in mere luck or God&#8217;s 
            grace, but just hard work and competitiveness. Bill&#8217;s Microsoft is 
            good competition for other software companies and he will continue 
            to stomp out the competition until he dies. He likes to play the 
            game of Risk and the game of world domination. His beliefs are so 
            powerful, which have helped him increase his wealth and his monopoly 
            in the industry. <BR><BR>Bill Gates is not a greedy person. In fact, 
            he is quite giving person when it comes to computers, internet and 
            any kind of funding. Some years back, he visited Chicagos Einstein 
            Elementary School and announced grants benefiting Chicagos schools 
            and museums where he donated a total of $110,000, a bunch of 
            computers, and provided internet connectivity to number of schools. 
            Secondly, Bill Gates donated 38 million dollars for the building of 
            a computer institute at Stanford University. Gates plans to give 
            away 95% of all his earnings when he is old and gray.</TD></TR>
