            href="./19.htm">Forex Trading 6 Advantages 
            Over Other Investments</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>There are many different advantages 
            to trading forex instead of futures or stocks, such as: 
            <BR><BR><B>1. Lower Margin</B> <BR><BR>Just like futures and stock 
            speculation, a forex trader has the ability to control a large 
            amount of the currency basically by putting up a small amount of 
            margin. However, the margin requirements that are needed for trading 
            futures are usually around 5% of the full value of the holding, or 
            50% of the total value of the stocks, the margin requirements for 
            forex is about 1%. For example, margin required to trade foreign 
            exchange is $1000 for every $100,000. What this means is that 
            trading forex, a currency traders money can play with 5-times as 
            much value of product as a futures traders, or 50 times more than a 
            stock traders. When you are trading on margin, this can be a very 
            profitable way to create an investment strategy, but its important 
            that you take the time to understand the risks that are involved as 
            well. You should make sure that you fully understand how your margin 
            account is going to work. You will want to be sure that you read the 
            margin agreement between you and your clearing firm. You will also 
            want to talk to your account representative if you have any 
            questions. <BR><BR>The positions that you have in your account could 
            be partially or completely liquidated on the chance that the 
            available margin in your account falls below a predetermined amount. 
            You may not actually get a margin call before your positions are 
            liquidated. Because of this, you should monitor your margin balance 
            on a regular basis and utilize stop-loss orders on every open 
            position to limit downside risk. <BR><BR><B>2. No Commission and No 
            Exchange Fees</B> <BR><BR>When you trade in futures, you have to pay 
            exchange and brokerage fees. Trading forex has the advantage of 
            being commission free. This is far better for you. Currency trading 
            is a worldwide inter-bank market that lets buyers to be matched with 
            sellers in an instant. <BR><BR>Even though you do not have to pay a 
            commission charge to a broker to match the buyer up with the seller, 
            the spread is usually larger than it is when you are trading 
            futures. For example, if you were trading a Japanese Yen/US Dollar 
            pair, forex trade would have about a 3 point spread (worth $30). 
            Trading a JY futures trade would most likely have a spread of 1 
            point (worth $10) but you would also be charged the brokers 
            commission on top of that. This price could be as low as $10 
            in-and-out for self-directed online trading, or as high as $50 for 
            full-service trading. It is however, all inclusive pricing though. 
            You are going to have to compare both online forex and your specific 
            futures commission charge to see which commission is the greater 
            one. <BR><BR><B>3. Limited Risk and Guaranteed Stops</B> 
            <BR><BR>When you are trading futures, your risk can be unlimited. 
            For example, if you thought that the prices for Live Cattle were 
            going to continue their upward trend in December 2003, just before 
            the discovery of Mad Cow Disease found in US cattle. The price for 
            it after that fell dramatically, which moved the limit down several 
            days in a row. You would not have been able to leave your position 
            and this could have wiped out the entire equity in your account as a 
            result. As the price just kept on falling, you would have been 
            obligated to find even more money to make up the deficit in your 
            account. <BR><BR><B>4. Rollover of Positions</B> <BR><BR>When 
            futures contracts expire, you have to plan ahead if you are going to 
            rollover your trades. Forex positions expire every two days and you 
            need to rollover each trade just so that you can stay in your 
            position. <BR><BR><B>5. 24-Hour Marketplace</B> <BR><BR>With 
            futures, you are generally limited to trading only during the few 
            hours that each market is open in any one day. If a major news story 
            breaks out when the markets are closed, you will not have a way of 
            getting out of it until the market reopens, which could be many 
            hours away. Forex, on the other hand, is a 24/5 market. The day 
            begins in New York, and follows the sun around the globe through 
            Europe, Asia, Australia and back to the US again. You can trade any 
            time you like Monday-Friday. <BR><BR><B>6. Free market place</B> 
            <BR><BR>Foreign exchange is perhaps the largest market in the world 
            with an average daily volume of US$1.4 trillion. That is 46 times as 
            large as all the futures markets put together! With the huge number 
            of people trading forex around the globe, it is very hard for even 
            governments to control the price of their own 
          currency.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Guidelines</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>So what is Forex trading you may ask? 
            Forex is the exchange you can buy and sell currencies. For example, 
            you might buy British pounds (by exchanging them to the dollars you 
            had), then, after pounds / dollar ratio goes up, you sell pounds and 
            buy dollars again. At the end of this operation you are going to 
            have more dollars, then you had at the beginning. <BR><BR>The Forex 
            market has much higher liquidity, then the stock market, as much 
            more money is being exchanged. Forex is spread between banks all 
            over the planet and as a result it means 24 hour trading. 
            <BR><BR>Unlike stocks, Forex trades are performed with high 
            leverage, usually it is 100. It means that by investing $1000 you 
            can control $100,000, and increase potential profits accordingly. 
            Some brokers provide also called mini Forex Trading, where the size 
            of minimum deposit equals $100. It makes possible for individuals to 
            enter this market easily. <BR><BR>The name convention. In Forex, the 
            name of a "symbol" is composed of two parts &#8212; one for first 
            currency, and another for the second currency. For example, the 
            symbol usdjpy stands for US dollars (usd) to Japanese yen (jpy). 
            <BR><BR>As with stocks, you can apply tools of the technical 
            analysis to Forex Trading charts. Traders indexes can be optimized 
            for Forex "symbols", allowing you to find winning strategy. 
            <BR><BR><B>Example Forex Trading transaction</B> <BR><BR>Assume you 
            have a online Forex trading account of $25,000 and you are trading 
            with a 1% margin requirement. The current quote for EUR/USD is 
            1.3225/28 and you place a market order to buy 1 lot of 100,000 Euros 
            at 1.3228, expecting the euro to rise against the dollar. At the 
            same time you place a stop-loss order at 1.3178 representing a 
            maximum loss of 2% of your account equity if the trade goes against 
            you, 50 pips below your order price, and a limit order at 1.3378, 
            150 pips above your order price. For this trade, you are risking 50 
            pips to gain 150 pips, giving you a risk/reward ratio of 1 part risk 
            to 3 parts reward. This means that you only need to be right one 
            third of the time to remain profitable. <BR><BR>The notional value 
            of this trade is $132,280 (100,000 1.3228). Your required margin 
            deposit is 1% of the total, which is equal to $1322.80 ($132,280 
            0.01). <BR><BR>As you expected, the Euro strengthens against the 
            dollar and your limit order is reached at 1.3378. The position is 
            closed. Your total profit for this trade is $1500, each pip being 
            worth $10.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Like many people I am sure you are 
            interested to know more about Forex trading. To put it bluntly Forex 
            trading can be either one the best ways to make money. Only those 
            who take the Forex market seriously will be able to make money with 
            it in the long term. <BR><BR>The Forex trading market is beyond a 
            doubt the worlds largest market where all exchanges happen 
            instantaneously. Thus, trades are a key challenge for even the most 
            knowledgeable Forex bankers and traders. They have to learn and 
            consider many factors before performing even a single trade. 
            <BR><BR>At first when currencies began to be traded openly, only 
            large banks were allowed to perform trades. These days, due to the 
            advent of internet forex trading and margin accounts almost anybody 
            can begin Forex trading. This in turn, has added to the liquidity of 
            the Forex market, and has resulted in a huge increase in the number 
            of individuals who are now active in the market. <BR><BR>So, does 
            this mean it is easy to earn money through Forex trading? To answer 
            this we must consider a few things. <BR><BR>If you want make 
            consistent money you can do extremely well by using Forex trading. 
            To help you in this end I have listed five key ways to improve your 
            odds dramatically of making money in the Forex market. <BR><BR><B>1. 
            Education</B> <BR><BR>Successful traders are knowledgeable about the 
            Forex market. They have chosen to educate themselves about every 
            single vital detail of Forex trading. The best traders know that 
            every trade that they perform is an opportunity to learn something 
            new about forex trading. <BR><BR><B>2. Forex Trading System</B> 
            <BR><BR>All of the profitable traders have a Forex trading system or 
            strategy. Furthermore, they have the will power to stick strictly to 
            that system, because the best traders know that by sticking with 
            their system they stand a far greater chance of earning money. 
            <BR><BR><B>3. Price Behavior</B> <BR><BR>Knowledgeable and 
            successful traders also include price behavior in their systems. 
            They have learned that prices can change quickly and suddenly but 
            are prepared to deal with those situations when they arrive. 
            <BR><BR><B>4. Trading Psychology</B> <BR><BR>First-rate traders are 
            aware of psychological issues that affect the choices of other 
            traders make when Forex trading. They know that people do not always 
            act rationally, and as a result this can alter the expected outcome 
            of a trade. This can help them both when deciding to enter into a 
            trade or when to exit. <BR><BR><B>5. Money Management</B> 
            <BR><BR>This is far and away the most important factor that will 
            determine whether or not you become a successful trader. Averting 
            the hazard of financial ruin is the main concern of all top traders. 
            This means both adequately funding your trading account (only with 
            money you can afford to live without of course) and never entering 
            into trades that can potentially wipe out all of your assets. Better 
            to start trading small and always use stop-loss orders to guarantee 
            that your first trades are not also your last. <BR><BR>This is by no 
            means an exhaustive list of everything you need to know but it 
            outlines some of the areas you need to consider before making even 
            that first trade. Now you know that it is not easy to earn money in 
            the Forex market, however it is achievable. <BR><BR>Also, remember 
            to try to have some fun. Just remember these three important things: 
            be disciplined in your trading habits, manager your money wisely and 
            enjoy the experience of Forex trading.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            From Home</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>What is Forex trading and how did the 
            name originate? <BR><BR>The Forex trading name derived from Foreign 
            Exchange. The first three letters of Foreign and the first two 
            letters of Exchange are added together. <BR><BR>Forex trading is 
            about dealing in international currencies to make money. When 
            trading in the stock market we sell the currency of one country to 
            buy that of another, hoping to make a good profit. <BR><BR>Before 
            the onset of the internet, Forex trading was open only to 
            multinational corporations and banks. Now, many people work from 
            home with their Forex trading money business. <BR><BR>The Forex 
            trader deals in Foreign Exchange at the most appropriate time to 
            profit from the transaction. Dealing in the stock market requires a 
            good ability to forecast the outcome of all currency transactions. 
            <BR><BR>Trading in the forex market is popular because although 
            there are frequent fluctuations in currencies, in percentage terms 
            they may be small. <BR><BR>You may then wonder how trading in 
            currencies can be such a lucrative earning opportunity since 
            fluctuations in exchange can be so little. However, when trading in 
            large volumes, a small change can mean a lot. <BR><BR>You can make a 
            lot of money Forex trading online in the stock market. But there are 
            certain conditions to follow before trading in foreign currencies. 
            <BR><BR>A thorough knowledge about the trends in the stock market is 
            required. You should also know the basics of this type of trading 
            and risk taking. Alternatively, you can use a robot for attaining 
            these conditions. Especially a robot that does all the forex trading 
            work for you! <BR><BR>You gain if the fluctuation favors you and the 
            reverse holds true as well. No one can accurately predict the trend 
            of the currencies. Liquidity is another reason why Foreign Exchange 
            is so popular. <BR><BR>You can make lots of money trading in 
            currencies, even if your initial investment is quite low. So 
            remember that even with a nominal investment, your earning ability 
            is certainly very large. <BR><BR>Most of the great businesses are 
            connected to the internet today, and Forex is no exception. It is 
            now easy for you to work from home and start trading in foreign 
            currencies. In fact, it is fully conducted online. You are at 
            liberty to choose when to start trading, without having to meet any 
            deadlines. <BR><BR>You can quickly start your own work from home 
            Forex trading business. The process of trading online in the 
            currency market is fairly simple for anyone to understand. 
            Especially with a currency robot that does all the trading work for 
            you.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>
