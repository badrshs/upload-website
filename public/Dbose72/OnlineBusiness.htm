            and Starting a Franchise</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Partnerships have a relatively low 
            rate of success when starting a franchise. Well, the same is true 
            for any business. Why? <BR><BR>Most partnerships fall apart within a 
            few years or even months because of mistakes during their 
            structuring process. In many cases partnerships are put together 
            because one person either can&#8217;t afford a business or does not have 
            the expertise to start one. <BR><BR>As a result, exited to find a 
            partner and fulfill an individual dream, entrepreneurs rush to get 
            started before taking care of some important details. Here are some 
            things that need to be considered when starting a franchise business 
            in a partnership: <BR><BR>1. What is the exits strategy? &#8211; Maker 
            sure that you share the same vision of where you want to be in 5 
            years. If an offer comes along to buy your franchise, what will you 
            do? <BR><BR>2. Decide what to do if you stop agreeing on things &#8211; 
            effective dispute resolution tools need to be put in place before 
            you get started. You are going to spend a lot of time with your 
            franchise partner, don&#8217;t expect to agree on everything. <BR><BR>3. 
            Decide who is the boss &#8211; it is almost impossible to run a 50/50 
            partnership. Someone needs to be the boss or the CEO. This way you 
            know who is responsible for a final decision from the beginning 
            instead of having to decide that each time on the spot. <BR><BR>4. 
            Consider a Limited Partnership &#8211; Make sure that all the liabilities 
            in your business are clearly spelled out. Getting a limited 
            partnership agreement in place might be the best way to go. v 5. 
            Look at some successful partnership examples &#8211; Baskin and Robbins 
            (ice cram franchise) come to mind. Take you time to research what 
            made other people successful in this arrangement. When considering a 
            partnership it also helps to consult an attorney in order to 
            incorporate all the details into a partnership agreement. <BR><BR>In 
            the end, partnership may be a great option for you, the key is to 
            give careful consideration to all your options and properly document 
            everything.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            href="./22.htm">Forex Trading</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>The Forex market is an inter-bank or 
            inter-dealer network first established in 1971 when many of the 
            world&#8217;s major currencies moved towards floating exchange rates. 
            Forex Trading is considered an over-the-counter (OTC) market, 
            meaning that transactions are not conducted on an exchange like some 
            equity stock markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or 
            the Chicago Options Board Exchange (CBOE) where options and futures 
            are traded. OTC trades exist as agreements made between two parties 
            that agree to trade via telephone or electronic network. <BR><BR>As 
            Forex trading has evolved, several locations have emerged as market 
            leaders. Currently, London, England contributes the greatest share 
            of transactions with over 32% of the total trades. Other Forex 
            trading centers&#8212;listed in order of volume&#8212; are New York, Tokyo, 
            Zurich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Paris, and Sydney. <BR><BR>Because 
            these trading centers cover most of the major time zones, FX trading 
            is a true 24-hour market that operates five days a week. For 
            example, as a trader in New York, you have access to the Forex 
            market starting Sunday evening when the market opens in Sydney for 
            the start of the trading week. Trading centers around the globe then 
            come online until New York closes at 4:30 PM EST. Of course, by this 
            time, Sydney will have reopened for the next trading day so you can 
            continue to trade around the clock until the New York close on 
            Friday. <BR><BR>Forex trading is again beneficial for it helps you 
            to perform complex analysis without mistakes. With access to your 
            computer, you can solve complex charting, sort out details of each 
            trading agreement minutely. Add to this, you have several forex 
            trading tools available online. These tools offer quick assistance 
            for forex trading in volumes. This is indeed a blessing for 
            newcomer, who often finds it tedious to track down the facts and 
            figures of forex market and forex trading agreement. <BR><BR>The 
            Forex market has become the world&#8217;s largest financial market, and it 
            is not uncommon to see over $3 trillion US traded each day. All 
            things you need to know and learn it up in Forex trading ; knowing 
            risk level - how much you are willing to lose, understanding the 
            different forex trading systems as technical and fundamental and 
            research the trading systems which you can be familiar with how they 
            work. <BR><BR>Forex trading courses are available as online courses 
            and also through printed books. Free tutorials and financial 
            guidance is also provided by many web sites. Choosing a professional

            href="./15.htm">Bill Gates - A story of 
            Success</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>William H. Gates is chairperson and 
            chief software architect of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide 
            leader in software services and Internet technologies for personal 
            and business computing. <BR><BR>Bill Gates was born on October 28, 
            1955 in a family having rich business, political and community 
            service background. His great-grandfather was a state legislator and 
            a mayor, his grandfather was vice president of national bank and his 
            father was a lawyer. <BR><BR>Bill strongly believes in hard work. He 
            believes that if you are intelligent and know how to apply your 
            intelligence, you can achieve anything. From childhood Bill was 
            ambitious, intelligent and competitive. These qualities helped him 
            to attain top position in the profession he chose. In school, he had 
            an excellent record in mathematics and science. Still he was getting 
            very bored in school and his parents knew it, so they always tried 
            to feed him with more information to keep him busy. Bill&#8217;s parents 
            came to know their sons intelligence and decided to enroll him in a 
            private school, known for its intense academic environment. It was a 
            very important decision in Bill Gates life where he was first 
            introduced to a computer. <BR><BR>Bill Gates and his friends were 
            very much interested in computer and formed "Programmers Group" in 
            late 1968. Being in this group, they found a new way to apply their 
            computer skill in university of Washington. In the next year, they 
            got their first opportunity in Information Sciences Inc. in which 
            they were selected as programmers. ISI (Information Sciences Inc.) 
            agreed to give them royalties whenever it made money from any of the 
            group&#8217;s program. As a result of the business deal signed with 
            Information Sciences Inc., the group also became a legal business. 
            <BR><BR>Bill Gates and his close friend Allen started new company of 
            their own, Traf-O-Data. They developed a small computer to measure 
            traffic flow. From this project they earned around $20,000. The era 
            of Traf-O-Data came to an end when Gates left the college. In 1973, 
            he left home for Harvard University. He didn&#8217;t know what to do, so 
            he enrolled his name for pre-law. He took the standard freshman 
            courses with the exception of signing up for one of Harvards 
            toughest mathematics courses. He did well over there, but he 
            couldn&#8217;t find it interesting too. He spent many long nights in front 
            of the schools computer and the next day asleep in class. 
            <BR><BR>After leaving school, he almost lost himself from the world 
            of computers. Gates and his friend Paul Allen remained in close 
            contact even though they were away from school. They would often 
            discuss new ideas for future projects and the possibility of 
            starting a business one fine day. At the end of Bills first year, 
            Allen came close to him so that they could follow some of their 
            ideas. That summer they got job in Honeywell. Allen kept on pushing 
            Bill for opening a new software company. <BR><BR>Within a year, Bill 
            Gates dropped out from Harvard. Then he formed Microsoft. Microsofts 
            vision is "A computer on every desk and Microsoft software on every 
            computer". Bill is a visionary person and works very hard to achieve 
            his vision. His belief in high intelligence and hard work has put 
            him where he is today. He does not believe in mere luck or God&#8217;s 
            grace, but just hard work and competitiveness. Bill&#8217;s Microsoft is 
            good competition for other software companies and he will continue 
            to stomp out the competition until he dies. He likes to play the 
            game of Risk and the game of world domination. His beliefs are so 
            powerful, which have helped him increase his wealth and his monopoly 
            in the industry. <BR><BR>Bill Gates is not a greedy person. In fact, 
            he is quite giving person when it comes to computers, internet and 
            any kind of funding. Some years back, he visited Chicagos Einstein 
            Elementary School and announced grants benefiting Chicagos schools 
            and museums where he donated a total of $110,000, a bunch of 
            computers, and provided internet connectivity to number of schools. 
            Secondly, Bill Gates donated 38 million dollars for the building of 
            a computer institute at Stanford University. Gates plans to give 
            away 95% of all his earnings when he is old and 
        gray.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Techniques: 5 Tips to Accomplish Your Big Dream</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Have you ever had a dream so big that 
            you had no idea how to accomplish it? The dream is there, in the 
            background of your mind, gnawing at you and clamoring for your 
            attention. <BR><BR>For many busy entrepreneurs, you might start to 
            feel like the dream is slowly dieing. With everything you have to do 
            to generate financial results, you never have time to focus on the 
            dream. You are always busy running your business, making money, 
            taking care of your clients, etc. Who has time to chase their 
            dreams? <BR><BR>When you let your dream die, it affects your 
            passion. Without passion, running your business can start to feel 
            like work (who wants that?). Passion is the fuel that gets you going 
            every day, provides the stamina to overcome the challenges and 
            obstacles, and inspires you to think bigger. <BR><BR>Recently I saw 
            an Oprah special called &#8220;Building a Dream&#8221; about the launch of her 
            Leadership Academy for young girls in South Africa. As I watched the 
            show, I realized that Oprah has been visioning this school for a 
            long time. She had clarity about so many details -- from the 
            uniforms to even the brick color of the building. It has been the 
            fuel that keeps her going ever day, overcoming the big obstacles 
            that have risen in running a billion dollar empire. <BR><BR>We all 
            know that Oprah is very busy with her show and her magazine. How she 
            brought her dream to life and fulfilled her passion was by 
            surrounding herself with a team of people who could bring her vision 
            to life. <BR><BR>If you study billionaires (which I do) you will 
            learn a special leverage technique they all use to manifest their 
            dreams into reality. I&#8217;ve seen this technique used by Oprah, Donald 
            Trump, Bill Gates, and Richard Branson. The technique: build a team 
            to bring the vision to life. <BR><BR><B>Here are five tips to help 
            you get started:</B> <BR><BR>1. Stay focused on the vision. Michael 
            Gerber&#8217;s In the Dreaming Room covers the power of what your REAL job 
            is (and by the way, it&#8217;s not getting lost in the day-to-day 
            management.) It&#8217;s all about creating a vision so big that it pulls 
            you forward. <BR><BR>2. Do YOUR job. Your job is to stay focused on 
            high payoff activities. Let others do what they do best. 
            Bookkeeping, housecleaning, graphic design, website updates, 
            filtering emails and phone calls are all low payoff activities for 
            the average business owner yet you many spend thousands of billable 
            hours a month on these tasks. <BR><BR>3. Surround yourself with 
            powerful implementers. When you leverage your time and build a team 
            of good people, then your dreams become real 100 times faster. Most 
            entrepreneurs are really great with ideas but lose traction when it 
            comes to details and managing projects. <BR><BR>4. Start sooner. In 
            completing the Virtual Team Building Secrets interviews, one thing I 
            found in common with all five experts is they waited too long to 
            build their team. It cost them time, money and sanity. The 
            billionaires I studied all took the risk to build a team 
            immediately. <BR><BR>5. Let go. Once you create your power team, be 
            sure to learn to delegate well. It doesn&#8217;t do anyone any good if you 
            hold the reigns too tight. A golden rule of delegation is, &#8220;Commit 
            to the outcome, let go of the path to get there.&#8221; <BR><BR>Its time 
            to start building YOUR team. It&#8217;s the fastest way to create more 
            time, free up energy and make progress in bringing your vision to 
            life.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Home Based Business</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Thousands of people have lost their 
            jobs or source of income in todays troubled economy. Absolutely no 
            one should feel that it cant happen to them. In addition to people 
            losing their jobs and source of income, there are millions more 
            coming out of college or coming of age, entering a job market that 
            is already stressed with high unemployment because of the turbulent 
            economy. <BR><BR>Considering the state of the economy it would be 
            wise to be resourceful, doing so by taking the initiative to create 
            an alternative source of income. Starting a Home Based Business will 
            allow you to generate needed income, be independent, and give you 
            peace of mind. <BR><BR>Generating needed income with a Home Based 
            Business could make a difference in your life. Particularly if you 
            have lost your job or source of income. It will give you a way to 
            take care and provide for yourself and loved ones. <BR><BR>Perhaps 
            you do have some income and your goal is to supplement or add to 
            what you have coming in, which will benefit you. <BR><BR>If you 
            value independence, you are really going to enjoy owning a Home 
            Business. How independence manifest itself varies from one person to 
            another. It could be that you want to spend more time with your 
            family and loved ones; Enjoy the convenience of not having to 
            commute to work; Be able to provide for yourself without assistance 
            from others; No boss looking over your shoulder; Being in a position 
            to come and go as you please. <BR><BR>Everyone desires peace of 
            mind, simply because, it is a wonderful state to be in. Anxiety 
            takes its toll on all of us. Having a Home Based Business to relieve 
            some of the pressure would be welcomed relief. <BR><BR>When we are 
            overly anxious as to how we are going to make it from day to day, 
            pay the mortgage or other bills, provide for the kids. <BR><BR>All 
            these anxieties can be mentally and physically exhausting. 
            <BR><BR>Yes, the economy is tough, and people will probably continue 
            to lose their jobs, their retirement income. These conditions may 
            continue for just a few years, or perhaps longer. <BR><BR>What we 
            dont want to do is be at the mercy of the conditions around us. We 
            want to be resourceful taking the initiative. One way of doing that 
            is to start a Home Based Business, which could provide needed 
            income, help you to be independent, and have peace of 
            mind.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>
