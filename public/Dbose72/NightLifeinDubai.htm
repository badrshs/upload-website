            Dubai? &amp; Best Home Based Business Opportunities in 
            Dubai</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Are you planning to start a business 
            in Dubai, doing an exhibition? Or looking for new business 
            opportunities in Dubai? Then I urge you to read every single word in 
            this page. <BR><BR>Business is the main focus of Dubai economy. 
            Often, the government is encouraging and creating new business 
            opportunities in Dubai. However, Dubai business set-up is not easy. 
            <BR><BR>You MUST know each and every step of setting up a business 
            in Dubai, unless you get a professional company to do this for you. 
            Don't worry. I will show you how to set-up a business in Dubai. Also 
            you can fill the form at the bottom of this page to get the best 
            business set-up company in Dubai to do all tasks for you (more info 
            at the bottom). <BR><BR><B>Common requirements to start a Dubai 
            business</B> <BR><BR>Every business in Dubai needs a &#8220;sponsor&#8221; 
            except if you want to open a business in a freezone in Dubai. 
            Usually, to open a business in a Dubai freezone requires a big 
            capital. It is not a place for small businesses. The sponsor MUST be 
            a UAE national. A strong sponsor with lot of contacts and influence 
            can be very useful for the business to start and run. Why? You will 
            see many reasons throughout this page. <BR><BR>You have to pay an 
            ongoing fee to the sponsor. There is a big chance that the sponsor 
            may demand a percentage of the profit in addition to the fee. 
            <BR><BR>Once you have acquired a sponsor, you have to register your 
            business and obtain the Trade License. There are different rules for 
            different business types. <BR><BR>For an example, there are specific 
            hygiene related rules to start and run a restaurant. It is not very 
            easy to register a business in Dubai. You may have to seek your 
            sponsor&#8217;s help to get your business registered. Language is a major 
            barrier when dealing with government employees. Otherwise there is a 
            big chance that the application will be rejected. 
            <BR><BR><B>Operating a business in Dubai</B> <BR><BR>Arabic is the 
            common language used in all government offices. Therefore every 
            company has to have an Arabic speaking employee or higher someone 
            temporary to deal with government institutions for various business 
            matters. This is a MUST. <BR><BR>The other important thing is the 
            working visa for employees. This is not easy and your sponsor&#8217;s 
            influence is very important in this matter. If you are planning to 
            run a large-scale business then you have to maintain a percentage of 
            UAE employees. Remember, you have to pay more than double to UAE 
            nationals. <BR><BR>There is no tax in Dubai. However, there are 
            different fees depending on type of the business. <BR><BR><B>What 
            are good Dubai business opportunities?</B> <BR><BR>Well, there are 
            many. But a good business opportunity in Dubai is always not the one 
            bringing more money. <BR><BR>It has to be easy to operate from 
            government rules perspective. Here is my review of good business 
            opportunities in Dubai. <BR><BR>Real Estate &#8211; I think there is still 
            a market in this booming business in Dubai. Dubai real estate 
            investment is not yet very popular internationally. So there is 
            still a market. Travel Packages &#8211; Emirates Airlines and few travel 
            agents handle Most of the travel packages. I think there is a market 
            for a business that is more focused on inbound tourists and travel 
            packages. <BR><BR><B>Online Auctions &#8211; Not much available in 
            Dubai.</B> <BR><BR>Exports &#8211; Some food items like Dates are very 
            cheap in Dubai. Also used cars and jewellery are very cheap in 
            Dubai. <BR><BR>Nightclubs &#8211; There is always a market in Dubai for 
            nightclubs. <BR><BR>Multi Level Marketing &#8211; Dubai has tough laws for 
            pyramid schemes. If you can get the government approval for a 
            genuine MLM then the sky is the limit. <BR><BR>Job agencies for 
            skilled labours &#8211; Almost all job agencies in Dubai are focusing on 
            jobs for professionals. This is a niche business opportunity in 
            Dubai. <BR><BR>Franchise businesses&#8211; This concept is new to Dubai 
            and I am sure there is a huge market for franchises. 
            <BR><BR>Childcare business &#8211; One of the burning issues especially 
            young working couples in Dubai is lack of childcare facilities. This 
            is also a niche business opportunity in Dubai for someone who wants 
            to start a business in Dubai. <BR><BR>You cannot ignore banks when 
            talking about business. Visit Dubai banks page to read about major 
            banks in Dubai. Also visit major companies in Dubai page to read 
            about leading companies in Dubai. <BR><BR><B>The easiest way to 
            set-up a business in Dubai</B> <BR><BR>The easiest way to start a 
            Dubai business is to get a professional consulting company to do all 
            tasks for you. In this way you can ensure that you are not wasting 
            your money. I managed to convince one of the best companies in Dubai 
            to evaluate requirements of visitors of this website and do 
            everything for you for a discounted price.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            go and what to do</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Dubai is almost dead during the day 
            and becomes alive at night. You can enjoy Dubai nightlife in various 
            ways depending on &#8220;what&#8221; you want. <BR><BR>Especially there are 
            specific Dubai nightclubs to cater deferent requirements and 
            clients.. <BR><BR>Dubai has excellent nightlife. However, you should 
            know the limitations, as there are strict laws in Dubai. 
            <BR><BR><B>Lets start with Dubai nightclubs&#8230;</B> <BR><BR>There are 
            varieties of nightclubs in Dubai. Some are free to enter and some 
            are charging an entrance fee. Visit Dubai Nighclubs page for more on 
            nightclubs and review of my favourite nightclubs. <BR><BR>Lets 
            continue with Dubai nightlife&#8230;. <BR><BR><B>Liquor</B> <BR><BR>Liquor 
            is not freely available in Dubai. That means there are no pubs or 
            bars along the road. There is a liquor permit issued for residence 
            visa holders. <BR><BR>If you are a visitor you will have to go to a 
            nightclub or to a bar in a hotel to get liquor. <BR><BR>Liquor is 
            expensive in Dubai, especially in nightclubs and in hotels. The best 
            option is to buy liquor from the Duty Free shop at the Dubai Airport 
            while coming into Dubai. <BR><BR><B>Bars</B> <BR><BR>Bars are not 
            available in all Dubai hotels mainly due to religious reasons. If 
            alcohol is part of your daily life then you should be careful when 
            selecting your accommodation. <BR><BR>Apart from that, most of the 
            hotels have bars. <BR><BR>Hanging around in a bar till midnight is 
            part of the nightlife in Dubai for most of the expatriates and 
            visitors. <BR><BR>Creek Park&#8230;. a nice place to hang around 
            <BR><BR>Dubai Creek Park is a nice place to visit at night. The park 
            is huge and therefore not crowded. <BR><BR>The atmosphere is 
            fantastic at night. There are play areas for children. You can just 
            relax in the park and enjoy the view of colourful buildings in the 
            other side of the creek. This is a nice place for the whole family. 
            <BR><BR>Shopping is a major part of Dubai nightlife. Visit Shopping 
            in Dubai page for more on shopping.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Islands</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Some people have described Dubai 
            islands as the 8th wonder of the world. There is no doubt that these 
            manmade islands in Dubai will impress each and every visitor. The 
            islands are built in such a way that it is hard to say they are 
            man-made islands. <BR><BR>These Dubai islands are completely manmade 
            from scratch in the Dubai coastal line. Constructions of these 
            islands launched after years of planning. Currently Dubai has two 
            island groups. <BR><BR><B>Palm Island Dubai</B> <BR><BR>Dubai Palm 
            Tree Island was the first manmade Dubai Island. The island is built 
            in the shape of a Date Palm Tree. There are three palm tree islands 
            being built in Dubai. <BR><BR><B>The Palm Island Jumeirah</B> 
            <BR><BR>Jumeirah beach is already famous thanks to Burj Al Arab 7 
            star hotel. The Palm island in Jumeirah will consists of luxury 
            accommodations such as hotels, villas, apartments etc. 
            <BR><BR><B>The Palm Island Jebel Ali</B> <BR><BR>Jebel Ali is the 
            industrial free trade zone in Dubai. The &#8220;theme&#8221; of Palm Island in 
            Jebel Ali is entertainment. <BR><BR>There are plans to build theme 
            parks and many more fascinating items for entertainments. Palm 
            Island Jebel Ali is bigger than the Jumeirah Palm Island. 
            <BR><BR><B>Palm Island Deira</B> <BR><BR>This is going to be the 
            third man-made Palm Island in Dubai. Deira is the &#8220;commercial 
            capital&#8221; in Dubai and this island will be built on the coast of 
            Dubai's Deirah beach. This is going to be the largest of all Palm 
            Islands. The &#8220;theme&#8221; of this island is &#8220;Residential&#8221; It will consist 
            of residential property, marinas, shopping malls, sports facilities, 
            and clubs. <BR><BR><B>The World</B> <BR><BR>The World is the latest 
            addition to Dubai islands. This is a collection of small islands 
            shaped into the world map. <BR><BR>The plan is to build 300 private 
            islands located off the coast of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. 
            It will consist of 300 small private man-made islands. <BR><BR>Size 
            of islands will range from 23000 to 83000 square meters. The World
