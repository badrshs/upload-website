            Blog Post Titles that Get Attention</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>The title of your blog post needs to 
            catch attention. If it fails to catch attention, then people wont 
            read the post. And the time spent writing the post will be wasted. 
            The title is also used in the search engines. So the title needs to 
            catch the attention of search engine users too. <BR><BR><B>What are 
            some techniques you can apply so your title gets attention?</B> 
            <BR><BR>First, you can include a benefit in your title. People want 
            to know whats in it for them or what advantages they can gain. By 
            including a benefit, youll get their attention and make them want to 
            read your post. <BR><BR>Another technique is to add urgency to your 
            title. Urgency makes them want to read your post now rather than 
            later. For instance, the title &#8220;Triple Your Productivity&#8221; is good 
            because it has a benefit. <BR><BR>But adding urgency will make it 
            even better. For example, you could say, &#8220;6 Shocking Secrets 
            Recently Discovered That Will Triple Your Productivity.&#8221; Or, &#8220;A Rare 
            Scientific Breakthrough Proven to Triple Your Productivity.&#8221; The 
            reader wants to learn those secrets or the breakthrough by reading 
            the post now rather than later. <BR><BR>You can also make your title 
            specific to get attention. For instance, instead of &#8220;Boost Your 
            Productivity,&#8221; you can make it more specific by saying, &#8220;8 Tips to 
            Boost Your Productivity.&#8221; <BR><BR>Another tip is to make your title 
            unique. If your title is similar to other titles that exist, or if 
            you use cliches, then itll be hard for your title to catch 
            attention. Your title needs to stand out by being unique. So instead 
            of &#8220;Boost Your Productivity,&#8221; you could say &#8220;Rapidly Increase Your 
            Productivity By Applying These Secrets That Few People Know.&#8221; 
            <BR><BR>Ideally, youll want to include more than one of these 4 
            elements in your title. If you combine them, itll add more power to 
            your title and really get attention.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            href="./24.htm">Fax - A Simple Guide To 
            Online Fax</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>While most people have heard of 
            email, there are many web users who have never heard of Internet or 
            online fax. This is the equivalent of sending faxes via the web 
            rather than through the old traditional facsimile machine in the 
            office. <BR><BR>Like email, web faxing is a relatively new 
            phenomenon which simply means using the Internet and your email 
            system to send and receive your faxes. In order to use online fax 
            you have to sign up for an account with an Internet fax service 
            provider, who will supply you with a Toll-Free or local fax number 
            you can use. Your faxes are sent as email attachment, usually in 
            TIFF or PDF format. <BR><BR>Your online fax service provider acts as 
            your intermediary to handle and process all your faxing. Keep in 
            mind, with an Internet faxing account you dont need an extra 
            dedicated fax phone line because everything is done via the web. 
            However, you can still send faxes to and from the old traditional 
            fax machine, your online provider will act on your behalf to process 
            your faxes. <BR><BR>With an Internet fax service you are generally 
            given an online site (interface) where you can log-on to send and 
            receive your faxes. This web account will also store your faxes so 
            that they are available to you at all times. How long and the amount 
            of faxes you can store will depend upon which service you choose, so 
            it pays to do a little homework first before you sign up to any one 
            service. <BR><BR>These fax providers will also have different 
            monthly rates but the average cost is around $10 a month, but there 
            are much cheaper quality services you can get, especially if your 
            faxing requirements are very minimum. Some services are as low as 
            $20 a year or you can also get a pay as you go service. 
            <BR><BR><B>Why are millions of individuals and companies switching 
            over to this new way of faxing?</B> <BR><BR>There are many reasons: 
            online faxing can be much cheaper especially when you factor in the 
            low start-up costs and the cost of a separate phone line. Online fax 
            is paperless so it is seen as more environmentally friendlier than 
            regular faxing. It also uses no inks, toners and there are none of 
            those messy annoying paper jams. No more missed faxes because of 
            busy signals. You can also send many faxes simultaneously. Web 
            faxing can also be much more secure than traditional faxing since 
            your faxes can be encrypted. Plus, all your faxing is completely 
            mobile, you can send and receive your faxes anywhere, anytime - as 
            long as you have Internet access and these days thats just about 
            everywhere on the planet. <BR><BR>This new way of faxing is much 
            more convenient since you can use laptops, PDAs, cell phones... to 
            send and receive your faxes. It is also extremely easy to use, as 
            simple as using email, anyone can do it. Furthermore, online faxing 
            is seen as the wave of the future, connecting all your faxing with 
            computers and the web. <BR><BR>Plus, we must not forget about the 
            whole concept of competitiveness when speaking about online fax. If 
            your business or company depends heavily on timely faxes for 
            bringing in sales, closing deals or communicating with clients; then 
            having a fax service thats available 24/7, 365 days of the year 
            (regardless of where youre located) is a definite advantage to have 
            in your corner. Sometimes it may just be a matter of keeping up with 
            your competition who might already be using web faxing in their own 
            businesses.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Wordpress is the Best Blogging Tool</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>WordPress is a free tool which allows 
            anyone for writing online and to publish a wordpress software-based 
            blog free of charge and reachable to every single person. 
            <BR><BR>The most important 3 features that blogger doesn&#8217;t support. 
            <BR><BR>1. A Pinging feature is provided to you by which wordpress 
            automatically pings all the RSS and blog feed directories each time 
            you update or make a new post. It&#8217;s a very great feature if you want 
            your blog to get a lot of traffic right away. It is the quickest way 
            to develop backlinks to your blog automatically. <BR><BR>If you 
            build a regular site, think how long it will get to index it in the 
            search engines as well as get backlinks to improve your listings, 
            and then start getting traffic. A tool like Wordpress can do all 
            that &#8220;grunge&#8221; work for you very easily. <BR><BR>2. Wordpress 
            Categories are the most effective way to improve the structure of 
            your site for both human visitors and for the search engines bot. 
            <BR><BR>Let&#8217;s assume the topic of your website is Wallpapers. You 
            could create a Category for Car wallpapers, one for Nature 
            wallpapers, and one for Cool wallpapers. When you add a posts to 
            your blog, you can select which of your categories does the post 
            belongs to. Now your blog will archive your past posts not only by 
            their month and date same as Blogger does. But also by the Category. 
            <BR><BR>So when you have a guests on your blog who is particularly 
            interested in Car wallpapers, is will be easy for them to find all 
            your posts on car wallpapers. Use of the categories can makes it 
            very easy and will save valuable time of your visitors. 
            <BR><BR>Categories are very search engine friendly, when you use 
            categories in your blog, there is a link on every one of your pages 
            to your categories. By using the Category feature, you will 
            ultimately have hundreds of pages on your site with links to car 
            wallpapers, nature wallpapers and cool wallpapers. All of those 
            backlinks to those keywords can help you to get higher in search 
            engine ranking. <BR><BR>3. You can easily create an RSS feed for 
            each of your categories. It means every time you post a new article 
            to your blog, it will ping the Blog / RSS directories for every 
            feed! <BR><BR>Think that if you put up a new page on a regular 
            website and even if the search engines find your new page right 
            away, it might take a month or two before it actually gets indexed 
            and starts getting traffic. It might be a long time before it enjoys 
            a first page position for its keywords. <BR><BR>It&#8217;s almost superb 
            how easily you could do all this with a well-organized blogging tool 
            like Wordpress!</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>
