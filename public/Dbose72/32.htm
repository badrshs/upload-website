        <TR>
          <TD colSpan=3>The competition for attention on online dating 
            services is intense. So intense, in fact, that some people resort to 
            lying or posting outdated photos to try and attract that next date. 
            <BR><BR>It's vital that you are honest in your profile and through 
            your photos so that you don't meet (or interact) with others under 
            false pretenses. <BR><BR>So then what are some important things you 
            can do to build a better profile? Here are three specific profile 
            tips you can use to improve your profile right now. <BR><BR><B>1) 
            Avoid Negativity</B> <BR><BR>Have you ever gone out on a first date 
            where the person you were with complained about his/her work, ex, 
            etc? Such negative talk is a major turnoff. Likewise, negativity is 
            a major turnoff in your profile. Being positive is like a magnet. 
            Being negative is like wearing a skunk aroma. Here's how one person 
            actually began her profile: <BR><BR>"To be quite honest, I have been 
            putting this off as long as possible. I have friends who use Match 
            and have had some terrible dates." <BR><BR>This begs to ask, "what 
            are you doing here?" Now contrast that to this profile introduction: 
            <BR><BR>"I've heard online dating is a great way to meet awesome 
            people and that's why I want to meet you." <BR><BR>Which one of 
            these profile intros is more attractive? The one who wants to date 
            "losers" or the one that wants to date "winners"? Psychologically 
            everyone wants to be a winner. Therefore in your profile, avoid 
            anything negative like the plague. Be positive. <BR><BR>If you have 
            anything negative in your profile ("I hate country music," "the last 
            guy I dated was a liar and cheater," "I'm sick of being alone," "I'm 
            sick of the bar scene," etc.) then go edit it out immediately and 
            replace it with something positive ("I love independent music and 
            artists, like..."). Always be positive; not just in your profile, 
            but also in life. <BR><BR><B>2) Go From Typical to Unique</B> 
            <BR><BR>Read this profile and tell me if you recognize it: 
            <BR><BR>"I am a fun person who loves movies and music. I like walks 
            on the beach, good conversation, and dining out. I'm looking for 
            someone who is fun and can make me laugh." <BR><BR>Unfortunately, 
            the above describes most profiles - typical and non-informative. 
            Beef up your profile to be more descriptive and unique. Instead of 
            "I like movies," say "my favorite movie is ____ because _______" or 
            use a movie character to describe you. "I'm a lot like _____ in 
            ______ because _______." <BR><BR>Use clever words that are 
            descriptive. Instead of saying "on hot days I like to go to the 
            ocean or on a hike," say, "on a sizzling day my adventurous side 
            leads me to traversing the ocean on a sailboat or discovering a new 
            waterfall that I can cool off under." <BR><BR>Instead of "I like to 
            discover new things," say, "I'm a lot like Indiana Jones in that I 
            love exploring the mysteries of life, while educating my mind to 
            appreciate new things." <BR><BR>Strive to make your profile 
            unordinary by spicing it up sentence by sentence. Be descriptive, 
            unique, and fun! <BR><BR><B>3) Filter Out Unwanteds<B> <BR><BR>Your 
            profile isn't about getting responses. It is about getting responses 
            from the type of person you are attracted to. Therefore, use 
            descriptions to help narrow your focus to what you want so that you 
            get responses from who you're looking for. <BR><BR>Instead of "I'm 
            looking for someone fun and humorous," say, "I'm looking for a 
            lighthearted man between the ages of 24 and 29 who enjoys the 
            humorous side of life. If you are clean-shaven and can hold a 
            conversation during a 150 mile car journey, then we may be a match. 
            Email me." <BR><BR>In the above example, you created three filters - 
            an age filter (24 and 29), and appearance filter (clean-shaven) and 
            a communication filter (good-communicator). And you did it without 
            offending. But you also created a response filter ("...we may be a 
            match. Email me.") You've helped tell the person what the next step 
            is if they meet your criteria. You've created a call to action, 
            which will help direct interested parties to email you versus 
            waiting. <BR><BR><B>Bonus Tip</B> <BR><BR>Change your header message 
            and main photo often. It keeps it fresh and interesting for people 
            doing searches and increases the chances of it being viewed. Be 
            creative. View some of our Top 10 lists of funny and philosophical 
            profile headers. <BR><BR>A great way to make your profile better is 
            to analyze profiles you really like. What is it that you like about 
            them? What makes the profiles different? <BR><BR>Now what will you 
            do to make your profile different?</B></B></TD></TR>
