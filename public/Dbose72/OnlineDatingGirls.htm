            href="./30.htm">Top 10 Important Dating 
            Tips for Men</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>There is a saying that "you never get 
            a second chance to make a good first impression." With that in mind, 
            it is vital to be fully prepared to make a great impression on each 
            date you go on. Here are 10 tips for men on dating success and 
            making an impression that will last. <BR><BR><B>1. Take a Bath or 
            Shower</B> <BR><BR>One of the worst things you could do when going 
            out on a date (especially if it is your first date) is to turn up 
            unshaven, looking dirty and smelling. Women are the cleaner of the 
            species and will partly judge you on how hygienic you are. After 
            all, you would be appalled if she turned up for the date looking 
            like a mutt dog with tangled fur that hadn't bathed for days. 
            <BR><BR>It doesn&#8217;t cost anything to take a bath and to make an 
            effort to look and smell nice. Remember, bad breath and body odor 
            are an instant turn off and she will assume that this is how you are 
            all the time even if you are just having a bad day. As a result, she 
            won&#8217;t be able to see beyond your appearance. <BR><BR><B>2. Arrive on 
            Time</B> <BR><BR>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t turn up late. Turning up 
            late will send out all the wrong impressions. At first she may think 
            she's been stood up, but after arriving late her opinion will change 
            to you being unreliable or not caring enough about her to be on 
            time. If you are picking her up from her home then it is advisable 
            to turn up five minute before you are due. Any earlier and you might 
            catch her adjusting her makeup or still getting ready. Five minutes 
            early is the earliest you should arrive. But never be late. 
            <BR><BR><B>3. Give Her a Thoughtful Gift</B> <BR><BR>A woman feels 
            special when the man she is with gives her a thoughtful gift. What 
            is a thoughtful gift? Well, you obvious know some things about a 
            woman before a first date that came from phone conversations, 
            emails, etc. Take what you know and buy her an appropriate date 
            gift. For example, let's say that the woman really likes golf. There 
            are companies that make chocolate golf sets - a miniature chocolate 
            club with a chocolate tee and chocolate golf ball. This would make a 
            great first date gift. For a generic thoughtful gift, buy a 
            chocolate rose. That's always appropriate without being overboard. 
            <BR><BR><B>4. Be a Gentleman</B> <BR><BR>Hold the door open for her, 
            let her walk through the doors first, pull her chair, and be polite 
            to her along with the people around you. Women like to feel special 
            and by treating her like a lady she will think you are fantastic. 
            <BR><BR><B>5. Compliment Her</B> <BR><BR>The first thing to say to 
            her is you look beautiful before you even ask how she is. Keep up 
            the compliments throughout your date, but do not go over board (3-4 
            for the night should be more than enough). A woman loves to be 
            complimented, to feel beautiful and to think that you are attracted 
            to her. The more sincere and observant your compliment, the bigger 
            impact it will have. But remember again not to go overboard. More 
            than four compliments may make you appear fake and not real. 
            <BR><BR><B>6. Listen to Her and Ask Questions</B> <BR><BR>Nobody 
            wants to spend the whole night listening to someone talk about 
            themselves. But you do have to get to know each other. Ask her 
            questions, but more importantly listen to what she has to say. A 
            woman is attracted to a man who is genuinely interested in hearing 
            what she has to say. Spend a lot more time asking her questions and 
            letting her talk than talking yourself. <BR><BR><B>7. Prepare for 
            the Conversation</B> <BR><BR>The last thing you want is to be 
            sitting at a meal with nothing to talk about. Think about your date 
            and what you would like to know about her. You may think that it is 
            easy to talk and that you will not run out of questions to ask or 
            that you will automatically have the answers but until you are in 
            the situation, you have no idea what it will be like. Avoid talking 
            about past relationships or other women while on the date. Keep your 
            focus, attention, and conversation fully on her. <BR><BR><B>8. Pay 
            for the Date</B> <BR><BR>It's virtually always appropriate for a 
            gentleman to offer to pay for the date. When a man takes it upon 
            himself to pay for the date, he is displaying that old act of 
            "chivalry" that is missing from many men these days. However, some 
            women feel more comfortable going "dutch" and if she insists on 
            this, then don't resist. To avoid awkwardness, make sure you let her 
            know before the date that you plan on paying for it. <BR><BR><B>9. 
            The Goodnight Kiss</B> <BR><BR>Some women prefer not to kiss after a 
            first date, while others may be disappointed if the guy doesn't even 
            try. There is no easy answer to this question. Body language and 
            chemistry throughout the night is key in the decision you make. If 
            it feels right, then you may want to consider making the move. If it 
            doesn't feel right then a friendly hug may be more appropriate. 
            <BR><BR><B>10. I'll Call You</B> <BR><BR>Only tell her that you will 
            call her if you mean it and intend on seeing her again. Do not, 
            under any circumstances, tell her you will call her if you are not 
            interested and have no plans to call her. In this case, when saying 
            goodbye, just say, "It was nice meeting you" and wish her luck. Or 
            you could just say good night, smile and walk a way. But if you do 
            like her and are interested, then you must let her 
          know.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>

            Online Relationship Scams</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>Searching for romance over the 
            Internet has become more and more popular over the years. Online 
            dating is nearly a billion dollar industry and scammers are cashing 
            in on the trend, taking advantage of unsuspecting men and women. 
            <BR><BR>Every day, scammers target hundreds of online daters, and 
            many have fallen prey to scams that cost online daters, on average, 
            of more than $3,000. They do it by posing as women overseas and send 
            you a note through an online dating service. They pretend to be 
            interested in you and provide their "email address" so that you can 
            continue communicating offline. <BR><BR>Scammers use email to try 
            and build an online relationship with you and they eventually 
            profess their love. Once you do too, the scam kicks into high gear. 
            An "emergency" (mother hospitalized, surgery needed) suddenly arises 
            and they ask for money. Or they say they want to meet you, but need 
            money to apply for a VISA to come see you. Little does the victim 
            know that he's talking to professional con artists and has likely 
            been communicating with another man, not a woman! The scams can get 
            quite complex, including men hiring a girl to call you and pose as 
            your online love interest. <BR><BR>You can avoid being a victim of 
            online relationship scams by taking note of these warning signs: 
            <BR><BR><B>Being Asked for Money</B> <BR><BR>This is the most 
            telltale sign of a scam. No matter what you think or what other 
            people might say, it just isn&#8217;t a normal behavior to ask for money 
            if you've never met someone in person. Scammers are quite creative &#8211; 
            they will ask you to help with airfare so they can come and visit, 
            cash a check, help out with an emergency for you to send a money 
            order and so on. Some will ask for money fairly quick and others 
            will show patience while trying to build a relationship with you, 
            getting you to fall for the imaginary person in the profile they set 
            up. <BR><BR><B>Initiating First Contact</B> <BR><BR>Scammers 
            virtually always are the first to initiate contact with you. If you 
            get an email (or wink) from someone overseas, it's best not to 
            respond. <BR><BR><B>Wanting to Communicate via Email</B> <BR><BR>An 
            online scammer will want to take your communications to email as 
            soon as possible because they know their profile may soon be deleted 
            when an online dating service notices their pattern of emailing 
            people. So many times in the very first or second email they will 
            give you an email address and ask you to email them. <BR><BR><B>Fake 
            Pictures</B> <BR><BR>Some scammers will cut or scan photos from 
            magazines. Trust your instincts. If you feel the photo is 
            suspicious, chances are it&#8217;s probably a fake. But that's not always 
            the case, as many scammers will actually steal someone else's photo 
            and post it. Photos are usually of a very beautiful woman. Don't 
            fall for it. <BR><BR><B>Unwillingness to Share Information</B> 
            <BR><BR>The person you are talking to showers you with attention and 
            he seems to be overly interested in everything about you, yet 
            doesn&#8217;t share a lot of information about themselves. If they are 
            avoiding your questions like a seasoned politician, then run.. 
            <BR><BR><B>Messages Vary</B> <BR><BR>If you are exchanging emails 
            with someone overseas, watch out for inconsistencies like a 
            variation in the style of the email, language differences, 
            repetitive statements, etc.. The scammer who initiated the 
            communication with you may not always be the same one that carries 
            it through. If something doesn't seem right about the emails you are 
            receiving, then its not right. <BR><BR>Besides looking out for red 
            flags you can take other measures to further protect yourself: 
            <BR><BR>1) Be the one always initiating communication via online 
            dating services. <BR>2) Guard your privacy. <BR>3) Communicate with 
            people locally, not overseas. <BR>4) Trust your gut instinct from 
            the start. <BR>5) Never reply to communications from someone who 
            sends you a note and immediately includes their email address for 
            you to continue the communication. <BR><BR>Many people have fallen 
            prey to online relationship scams. In one case, two men showed up at 
            the same airport to meet a girl from overseas that they had sent 
            money to for her "flight". Both were left holding flowers at the 
            airport staring at each other. They had apparently been duped by the 
            same scammer. <BR><BR>While it is true that there are many people 
            who find life partners over the Internet, it is best to always be on

            href="./32.htm">Three Ways to Build a 
            Better Online Dating Profile</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>The competition for attention on 
            online dating services is intense. So intense, in fact, that some 
            people resort to lying or posting outdated photos to try and attract 
            that next date. <BR><BR>It's vital that you are honest in your 
            profile and through your photos so that you don't meet (or interact) 
            with others under false pretenses. <BR><BR>So then what are some 
            important things you can do to build a better profile? Here are 
            three specific profile tips you can use to improve your profile 
            right now. <BR><BR><B>1) Avoid Negativity</B> <BR><BR>Have you ever 
            gone out on a first date where the person you were with complained 
            about his/her work, ex, etc? Such negative talk is a major turnoff. 
            Likewise, negativity is a major turnoff in your profile. Being 
            positive is like a magnet. Being negative is like wearing a skunk 
            aroma. Here's how one person actually began her profile: <BR><BR>"To 
            be quite honest, I have been putting this off as long as possible. I 
            have friends who use Match and have had some terrible dates." 
            <BR><BR>This begs to ask, "what are you doing here?" Now contrast 
            that to this profile introduction: <BR><BR>"I've heard online dating 
            is a great way to meet awesome people and that's why I want to meet 
            you." <BR><BR>Which one of these profile intros is more attractive? 
            The one who wants to date "losers" or the one that wants to date 
            "winners"? Psychologically everyone wants to be a winner. Therefore 
            in your profile, avoid anything negative like the plague. Be 
            positive. <BR><BR>If you have anything negative in your profile ("I 
            hate country music," "the last guy I dated was a liar and cheater," 
            "I'm sick of being alone," "I'm sick of the bar scene," etc.) then 
            go edit it out immediately and replace it with something positive 
            ("I love independent music and artists, like..."). Always be 
            positive; not just in your profile, but also in life. <BR><BR><B>2) 
            Go From Typical to Unique</B> <BR><BR>Read this profile and tell me 
            if you recognize it: <BR><BR>"I am a fun person who loves movies and 
            music. I like walks on the beach, good conversation, and dining out. 
            I'm looking for someone who is fun and can make me laugh." 
            <BR><BR>Unfortunately, the above describes most profiles - typical 
            and non-informative. Beef up your profile to be more descriptive and 
            unique. Instead of "I like movies," say "my favorite movie is ____ 
            because _______" or use a movie character to describe you. "I'm a 
            lot like _____ in ______ because _______." <BR><BR>Use clever words 
            that are descriptive. Instead of saying "on hot days I like to go to 
            the ocean or on a hike," say, "on a sizzling day my adventurous side 
            leads me to traversing the ocean on a sailboat or discovering a new 
            waterfall that I can cool off under." <BR><BR>Instead of "I like to 
            discover new things," say, "I'm a lot like Indiana Jones in that I 
            love exploring the mysteries of life, while educating my mind to 
            appreciate new things." <BR><BR>Strive to make your profile 
            unordinary by spicing it up sentence by sentence. Be descriptive, 
            unique, and fun! <BR><BR><B>3) Filter Out Unwanteds<B> <BR><BR>Your 
            profile isn't about getting responses. It is about getting responses 
            from the type of person you are attracted to. Therefore, use 
            descriptions to help narrow your focus to what you want so that you 
            get responses from who you're looking for. <BR><BR>Instead of "I'm 
            looking for someone fun and humorous," say, "I'm looking for a 
            lighthearted man between the ages of 24 and 29 who enjoys the 
            humorous side of life. If you are clean-shaven and can hold a 
            conversation during a 150 mile car journey, then we may be a match. 
            Email me." <BR><BR>In the above example, you created three filters - 
            an age filter (24 and 29), and appearance filter (clean-shaven) and 
            a communication filter (good-communicator). And you did it without 
            offending. But you also created a response filter ("...we may be a 
            match. Email me.") You've helped tell the person what the next step 
            is if they meet your criteria. You've created a call to action, 
            which will help direct interested parties to email you versus 
            waiting. <BR><BR><B>Bonus Tip</B> <BR><BR>Change your header message 
            and main photo often. It keeps it fresh and interesting for people 
            doing searches and increases the chances of it being viewed. Be 
            creative. View some of our Top 10 lists of funny and philosophical 
            profile headers. <BR><BR>A great way to make your profile better is 
            to analyze profiles you really like. What is it that you like about 
            them? What makes the profiles different? <BR><BR>Now what will you 
            do to make your profile different?</DIV></DIV></B></B></TD></TR>

            href="./33.htm">12 Tips For Safe Online 
            Dating</A></DIV>
            <DIV id=cat_art_dtls class=txt>There&#8217;s a nervousness, thrill, and 
            excitement that occurs when meeting a person for the first time face 
            to face. Yet amongst the thrill, remember to always be on your guard 
            when going out on a date with someone you barely know. <BR><BR>Here 
            are 12 tips on dating safety to help you get started: <BR><BR><B>1. 
            Arrange to meet him.</B> <BR><BR>When meeting for the first time, 
            never allow your date to pick you up from your home. In fact, your 
            date shouldn't even know your home address yet! <BR><BR><B>2. Meet 
            in public places.</B> <BR><BR>For a first meeting, always meet in a 
            public place where other people are in close proximity. You may also 
            want to consider going out with a group of people, or a double date. 
            <BR><BR><B>3. Go dutch by paying half of the bill.</B> <BR><BR>It's 
            always respectful for the man to offer to pay the bill. 
            Unfortunately, some men ruin the gesture by expecting something in 
            return. Therefore it may not be a bad idea for you to go dutch. Pay 
            half the bill so that you won't feel under any obligation to 
            "return" the favor. <BR><BR><B>4. Remember that alcohol affects your 
            judgment.</B> <BR><BR>The biggest threat to a person's judgment, 
            when on a date, is alcohol. Not only does it affect your judgment, 
            but alcohol also lessens your inhibitions. If you are drinking, keep 
            your drink in sight at all times and don&#8217;t get so drunk that you 
            don&#8217;t know what you are doing. Better yet, try to avoid alcohol on 
            your first date. <BR><BR><B>5. Use your own mode of 
            transportation.</B> <BR><BR>Provide your own transportation to your 
            public meeting place and make sure you have more than enough gas. 
            <BR><BR><B>6. Don't assume that a man is safe.</B> <BR><BR>It's 
            important never to let your guard down when on a first date. Never 
            assume a man is safe just because he claims to be religious or a 
            gentleman. <BR><BR><B>7. Don&#8217;t let him know where you live.</B> 
            <BR><BR>If you want to see him again, arrange a second date and then 
            take it from there. <BR><BR><B>8. Avoid secluded areas.</B> 
            <BR><BR>Remember - stay in a public place for your first date and 
            avoid secluded areas such as parks. <BR><BR><B>9. Listen to your 
            gut.</B> <BR><BR>If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. 
            And if you haven&#8217;t met him before, and you know at the beginning of 
            the date that something doesn&#8217;t feel right, then leave immediately. 
            <BR><BR><B>10. Always let someone else know where you're going.</B> 
            <BR><BR>Be sure someone knows where you are going and who you'll be 
            with. You might even consider arranging a time to call and check in. 
            Or you could arrange to meet up with friends later that night. 
            <BR><BR><B>11. Give him your cell phone number.</B> <BR><BR>It's 
            safer to give out a cell phone number instead of your home phone 
            number (click here for why). <BR><BR><B>12. Always remain alert.</B> 
            <BR><BR>Even if you&#8217;re having a blast and the chemistry is great, 
            it&#8217;s a good idea to remain alert the whole evening. Make sure you 
            have a cell phone on you. <BR><BR>Dating safely is very important. 
            In the initial stages of dating and online dating, you are still 
            getting to know someone you know very little about. By creating a 
            safe environment to know the person, you&#8217;re creating a better 
            situation for yourself.</DIV></DIV></TD></TR>
