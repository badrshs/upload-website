          <TD colSpan=3>There is a saying that "you never get a second chance 
            to make a good first impression." With that in mind, it is vital to 
            be fully prepared to make a great impression on each date you go on. 
            Here are 10 tips for men on dating success and making an impression 
            that will last. <BR><BR><B>1. Take a Bath or Shower</B> <BR><BR>One 
            of the worst things you could do when going out on a date 
            (especially if it is your first date) is to turn up unshaven, 
            looking dirty and smelling. Women are the cleaner of the species and 
            will partly judge you on how hygienic you are. After all, you would 
            be appalled if she turned up for the date looking like a mutt dog 
            with tangled fur that hadn't bathed for days. <BR><BR>It doesn&#8217;t 
            cost anything to take a bath and to make an effort to look and smell 
            nice. Remember, bad breath and body odor are an instant turn off and 
            she will assume that this is how you are all the time even if you 
            are just having a bad day. As a result, she won&#8217;t be able to see 
            beyond your appearance. <BR><BR><B>2. Arrive on Time</B> 
            <BR><BR>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t turn up late. Turning up late will 
            send out all the wrong impressions. At first she may think she's 
            been stood up, but after arriving late her opinion will change to 
            you being unreliable or not caring enough about her to be on time. 
            If you are picking her up from her home then it is advisable to turn 
            up five minute before you are due. Any earlier and you might catch 
            her adjusting her makeup or still getting ready. Five minutes early 
            is the earliest you should arrive. But never be late. <BR><BR><B>3. 
            Give Her a Thoughtful Gift</B> <BR><BR>A woman feels special when 
            the man she is with gives her a thoughtful gift. What is a 
            thoughtful gift? Well, you obvious know some things about a woman 
            before a first date that came from phone conversations, emails, etc. 
            Take what you know and buy her an appropriate date gift. For 
            example, let's say that the woman really likes golf. There are 
            companies that make chocolate golf sets - a miniature chocolate club 
            with a chocolate tee and chocolate golf ball. This would make a 
            great first date gift. For a generic thoughtful gift, buy a 
            chocolate rose. That's always appropriate without being overboard. 
            <BR><BR><B>4. Be a Gentleman</B> <BR><BR>Hold the door open for her, 
            let her walk through the doors first, pull her chair, and be polite 
            to her along with the people around you. Women like to feel special 
            and by treating her like a lady she will think you are fantastic. 
            <BR><BR><B>5. Compliment Her</B> <BR><BR>The first thing to say to 
            her is you look beautiful before you even ask how she is. Keep up 
            the compliments throughout your date, but do not go over board (3-4 
            for the night should be more than enough). A woman loves to be 
            complimented, to feel beautiful and to think that you are attracted 
            to her. The more sincere and observant your compliment, the bigger 
            impact it will have. But remember again not to go overboard. More 
            than four compliments may make you appear fake and not real. 
            <BR><BR><B>6. Listen to Her and Ask Questions</B> <BR><BR>Nobody 
            wants to spend the whole night listening to someone talk about 
            themselves. But you do have to get to know each other. Ask her 
            questions, but more importantly listen to what she has to say. A 
            woman is attracted to a man who is genuinely interested in hearing 
            what she has to say. Spend a lot more time asking her questions and 
            letting her talk than talking yourself. <BR><BR><B>7. Prepare for 
            the Conversation</B> <BR><BR>The last thing you want is to be 
            sitting at a meal with nothing to talk about. Think about your date 
            and what you would like to know about her. You may think that it is 
            easy to talk and that you will not run out of questions to ask or 
            that you will automatically have the answers but until you are in 
            the situation, you have no idea what it will be like. Avoid talking 
            about past relationships or other women while on the date. Keep your 
            focus, attention, and conversation fully on her. <BR><BR><B>8. Pay 
            for the Date</B> <BR><BR>It's virtually always appropriate for a 
            gentleman to offer to pay for the date. When a man takes it upon 
            himself to pay for the date, he is displaying that old act of 
            "chivalry" that is missing from many men these days. However, some 
            women feel more comfortable going "dutch" and if she insists on 
            this, then don't resist. To avoid awkwardness, make sure you let her 
            know before the date that you plan on paying for it. <BR><BR><B>9. 
            The Goodnight Kiss</B> <BR><BR>Some women prefer not to kiss after a 
            first date, while others may be disappointed if the guy doesn't even 
            try. There is no easy answer to this question. Body language and 
            chemistry throughout the night is key in the decision you make. If 
            it feels right, then you may want to consider making the move. If it 
            doesn't feel right then a friendly hug may be more appropriate. 
            <BR><BR><B>10. I'll Call You</B> <BR><BR>Only tell her that you will 
            call her if you mean it and intend on seeing her again. Do not, 
            under any circumstances, tell her you will call her if you are not 
            interested and have no plans to call her. In this case, when saying 
            goodbye, just say, "It was nice meeting you" and wish her luck. Or 
            you could just say good night, smile and walk a way. But if you do 
            like her and are interested, then you must let her know.</TD></TR>
