Due to the importance of reliability and safe operation of WMRs, this paper presents a survey of state-of-the-art in FDD &amp; FTC of WMRs under unknown environments. Firstly, we briefly introduce main components, typical kinematics models and fault models of WMRs and error models of inertial navigation sensors. Secondly, we discuss main approaches for FDD/FTC of WMRs, including multiple model based approach, particle filter based approach, sensor fusion based approach, layered fault tolerant architecture and so on. At last, the main challenges, difficulties and some future trends for the field are offered.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: We present a vision based navigation system which has an error recovery function for an autonomous mobile robot. A misrecognition of landmark causes the robot to mislocate itself. When this happens, the robot is unable to perform its primary objective. In order to solve this kind of problem, we have proposed a hierarchical control architecture "HALAS" (hierarchical adaptive and learning architecture system). This consists of some modules which are arranged hierarchically and each module means a single function of this robot. When one module fails in its aim, the upper module detects the error and recovers from it using other useful information from its knowledge data base. We show experimentally that the robot gets a higher reliability in autonomous mobility because the map correspondence module finds the error which has been caused by an anemo perception module (landmark recognition module) and it corrects the error utilizing its map information.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Being able to navigate accurately is one of the fundamental capabilities of a mobile robot to effectively execute a variety of tasks including docking, transportation, and manipulation. As real-world environments often contain changing or ambiguous areas, existing features can be insufficient for mobile robots to establish a robust navigation behavior. A popular approach to overcome this problem and to achieve accurate localization is to use artificial landmarks. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally placing such artificial landmarks for mobile robots that repeatedly have to carry out certain navigation tasks. Our method aims at finding the minimum number of landmarks for which a bound on the maximum deviation of the robot from its desired trajectory can be guaranteed with high confidence. The proposed approach incrementally places landmarks utilizing linearized versions of the system dynamics of the robot, thus allowing for an efficient computation of the deviation guarantee. We evaluate our approach in extensive experiments carried out both in simulations and with real robots. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches and is suitable for long-term operation of mobile robots.</td>

To deal with the stability-plasticity dilemma (the trade-off between adaptation to new patterns and preservation of old patterns), the environment is represented at multiple timescales simultaneously (5 in our experiments). A sample-based representation is proposed, where older memories fade at different rates depending on the timescale, and robust statistics are used to interpret the samples. The dynamics of this representation are analysed in a five week experiment, measuring the relative influence of short- and long-term memories over time, and further demonstrating the robustness of the approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mobile robot vision-based navigation has been the source of countless research contributions, from the domains of both vision and control. Vision is becoming more and more common in applications such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation, path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection. This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept of visual sonar has also been revised.</td>

An example of such applications is the exploration of unknown terrains, such as the zone of an earthquake or a similar disaster. In any such scenarios errors in the UV's sensors or systems used for localization may be present. Due to the harsh environment, errors can not be avoided. Thus, a localization technique that can operate effectively even in the presence of errors is highly desirable. In this paper, a technique used for 3D localization is presented. The technique operates with heterogeneous swarm of autonomous robotic systems, is scalable and robust enough to attain a position estimate even in the presence of errors in the available sensor information.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: This paper is about long-term navigation in environments whose appearance changes over time - suddenly or gradually. We describe, implement and validate an approach which allows us to incrementally learn a model whose complexity varies naturally in accordance with variation of scene appearance. It allows us to leverage the state of the art in pose estimation to build over many runs, a world model of sufficient richness to allow simple localisation despite a large variation in conditions. As our robot repeatedly traverses its workspace, it accumulates distinct visual experiences that in concert, implicitly represent the scene variation - each experience captures a visual mode. When operating in a previously visited area, we continually try to localise in these previous experiences while simultaneously running an independent vision based pose estimation system. Failure to localise in a sufficient number of prior experiences indicates an insufficient model of the workspace and instigates the laying down of the live image sequence as a new distinct experience. In this way, over time we can capture the typical time varying appearance of an environment and the number of experiences required tends to a constant. Although we focus on vision as a primary sensor throughout, the ideas we present here are equally applicable to other sensor modalities. We demonstrate our approach working on a road vehicle operating over a three month period at different times of day, in different weather and lighting conditions. In all, we process over 136,000 frames captured from 37km of driving.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: Robust, scalable place recognition is a core competency for many robotic applications. However, when revisiting places over and over, many state-of-the-art approaches exhibit reduced performance in terms of computation and memory complexity and in terms of accuracy. For successful deployment of robots over long time scales, we must develop algorithms that get better with repeated visits to the same environment, while still working within a fixed computational budget. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that alternates between online place recognition and offline map maintenance with the goal of producing the best performance with a fixed map size. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map, we use a scoring function that ranks the utility of each landmark and a sampling policy that selects the landmarks for each place. The Summary Map can then be used by any descriptor-based inference method for constant-complexity online place recognition. We evaluate a number of scoring functions and sampling policies and show that it is possible to build and maintain maps of a constant size and that place-recognition performance improves over multiple visits.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper a system for simultaneous navigation and monitoring with autonomous reaction to failures is going to be presented. This system is part of a complete navigation system called AURON (Autonomous Robot Navigation). The AURON System autonomy is based on the interaction of four main components: the autonomous generation of an environment representation, the planning of a sequence of actions and perceptions which guide the robot from an initial event to a final one, the navigation that converts sequences in real movements and supervises all the process, and the relocalization that allows to place the robot again in the representation. This system has been implemented in a mobile robot control architecture called AD. AD is a two level architecture: deliberative and automatic. The paper is focused in one deliberative skill, the navigation skill.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract— We propose a method for evaluating the localization accuracy of an indoor navigation system in arbitrarily large environments. Instead of using externally mounted sensors, as required by most ground-truth systems, our approach involves mounting only landmarks consisting of distinct patterns printed on inexpensive foam boards. A pose estimation algorithm computes the pose of the robot with respect to the land- mark using the image obtained by an on-board camera. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of providing accurate estimates of a mobile robot’s position and orientation with respect to the landmarks in arbitrarily-sized environments over arbitrarily-long trials. Furthermore, because the approach involves minimal outfitting of the environment, we show that only a small amount of setup time is needed to apply the method to a new environment. Experiments involving a state-of-the-art navigation system demonstrate the ability of the method to facilitate accurate localization measurements over arbitrarily long periods of time.</td>

The proposed method is computationally efficient, needs off-the-shelf equipment only and does not require any additional infrastructure like radio beacons or GPS. Contrary to traditional localization algorithms, which use advanced mathematical methods to determine vehicle position, our method uses a more practical approach. In our case, an image-feature-based monocular vision technique determines only the heading of the vehicle while the vehicle's odometry is used to estimate the distance traveled. We present a mathematical proof and experimental evidence indicating that the localization error of a robot guided by this principle is bound. The experiments demonstrate that the method can cope with variable illumination, lighting deficiency and both short- and long-term environment changes. This makes the method especially suitable for deployment in scenarios which require long-term autonomous operation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research domain due to its extensive applications. The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: The challenge of persistent appearance-based navigation and mapping is to develop an autonomous robotic vision system that can simultaneously localize, map and navigate over the lifetime of the robot. However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods typically scale not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform; also, repeated revisits to locations will develop multiple competing representations which reduce recall performance. In this paper we present a solution to the persistent localization, mapping and global path planning problem in the context of a delivery robot in an office environment over a one-week period. Using a graphical appearance-based SLAM algorithm, CAT-Graph, we demonstrate constant time and memory loop closure detection with minimal degradation during repeated revisits to locations, along with topological path planning that improves over time without using a global metric representation. We compare the localization performance of CAT-Graph to openFABMAP, an appearance-only SLAM algorithm, and the path planning performance to occupancy-grid based metric SLAM. We discuss the limitations of the algorithm with regard to environment change over time and illustrate how the topological graph representation can be coupled with local movement behaviors for persistent autonomous robot navigation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an alternative approach to the problem of outdoor, persistent visual localisation against a known map. Instead of blindly applying a feature detector/descriptor combination over all images of all places, we leverage prior experiences of a place to learn place-dependent feature detectors (i.e., features that are unique to each place in our map and used for localisation). Furthermore, as these features do not represent low-level structure, like edges or corners, but are in fact mid-level patches representing distinctive visual elements (e.g., windows, buildings, or silhouettes), we are able to localise across extreme appearance changes. Note that there is no requirement that the features posses semantic meaning, only that they are optimal for the task of localisation. This work is an extension on previous work (McManus et al. in Proceedings of robotics science and systems, 2014b) in the following ways: (i) we have included a landmark refinement and outlier rejection step during the learning phase, (ii) we have implemented an asynchronous pipeline design, (iii) we have tested on data collected in an urban environment, and (iv) we have implemented a purely monocular system. Using over 100 km worth of data for training, we present localisation results from Begbroke Science Park and central Oxford.</td>

It insists on the need for an integrated conception of such procedures, which must be tightly tailored to the specific robot that is used, notably to the capacities and limitations of its sensory-motor equipment, and to the specific environment that is experienced. A hierarchy of navigation strategies is outlined in the discussion, together with the sort of adaptive capacities each affords to cope with unexpected obstacles or dangers encountered on an animat or robot’s way to its goal. </td>

Such uncertainties may cause unexpected error situations that often lead to navigation failure. Therefore, the robot should be able to recover from these unexpected error situations. This paper proposes an error recovery framework based on generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN). The approach can provide several advantages. The proposed framework can model various error situations occurring in real environments, thereby enabling a robot to recover from error situations autonomously. The modeling, analysis, and performance evaluation can be also carried out using the GSPN model. Experimental results show that the proposed error recovery framework is useful for dependable navigation of a mobile robot operating autonomously.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper proposes an approach to achieve resilient navigation for indoor mobile robots. Resilient navigation seeks to mitigate the impact of control, localisation, or map errors on the safety of the platform while enforcing the robot’s ability to achieve its goal. We show that resilience to unpredictable errors can be achieved by combining the benefits of independent and complementary algorithmic approaches to navigation, or modalities, each tuned to a particular type of environment or situation. In this paper, the modalities comprise a path planning method and a reactive motion strategy. While the robot navigates, a Hidden Markov Model continually estimates the most appropriate modality based on two types of information: context (information known a priori) and monitoring (evaluating unpredictable aspects of the current situation). The robot then uses the recommended modality, switching between one and another dynamically. Experimental validation with a SegwayRMP-based platform in an office environment shows that our approach enables failure mitigation while maintaining the safety of the platform. The robot is shown to reach its goal in the presence of: 1) unpredicted control errors, 2) unexpected map errors and 3) a large injected localisation fault.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We present a lifelong mapping and localisation system for long-term autonomous operation of mobile robots in changing environments. The core of the system is a spatio-temporal occupancy grid that explicitly represents the persistence and periodicity of the individual cells and can predict the probability of their occupancy in the future. During navigation, our robot builds temporally local maps and integrates then into the global spatio-temporal grid. Through re-observation of the same locations, the spatio-temporal grid learns the long-term environment dynamics and gains the ability to predict the future environment states. This predictive ability allows to generate time-specific 2d maps used by the robot's localisation and planning modules. By analysing data from a long-term deployment of the robot in a human-populated environment, we show that the proposed representation improves localisation accuracy and the efficiency of path planning. We also show how to integrate the method into the ROS navigation stack for use by other roboticists.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: Reliable navigation is a very important part of an autonomous mobile robot system. This means for instance that the robot should not lose track of its position, even if unexpected events like wheel slip and collisions occur. The standard approach to this problem is to construct a navigation system that is robust in itself. This paper proposes that detecting faults can also be made outside the normal navigation system, as an additional fault detector. Besides increasing the robustness, a means for detecting deviations is obtained, which can be important for the rest of the robot system, for instance the top level planner. The method uses two or more sources of robot position estimates, and compares them to detect unexpected deviation without getting deceived by drift or different characteristics in the position systems it gets information from. Both relative and absolute position sources can be used, meaning that existing positioning systems already implemented can be used in the detector. For detection purposes, an extended Kalman filter is used in conjunction with a CUSUM test. The detector is able to not only detect faults, but also give an estimate of when the fault occurred, which is useful for doing fault recovery. The detector is easy to implement, as it requires no modification of existing systems. Also the computational demands are very low. The approach is implemented and demonstrated on a mobile robot, using odometry and a scan matcher as sources of position information. It is shown that the system is able to detect wheel slip in real-time</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot localization systems typically assume that the environment is static, ignoring the dynamics inherent in most real-world settings. Corresponding scenarios include households, offices, warehouses and parking lots, where the location of certain objects such as goods, furniture or cars can change over time. These changes typically lead to inconsistent observations with respect to previously learned maps and thus decrease the localization accuracy or even prevent the robot from globally localizing itself. In this paper we present a sound probabilistic approach to lifelong localization in changing environments using a combination of a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter with a hidden Markov model. By exploiting several properties of this model, we obtain a highly efficient map management approach for dynamic environments, which makes it feasible to run our algorithm online. Extensive experiments with a real robot in a dynamically changing environment demonstrate that our algorithm reliably adapts to changes in the environment and also outperforms the popular Monte-Carlo localization approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: This paper presents a global localization method in which the robot can relocalize itself when getting lost due to large slippage and kidnapping. In the proposed method, the robot generates pose hypotheses using a global scan matching method. The robot selects one hypothesis as the correct pose by filtering out false hypotheses using a multiple hypothesis tracking scheme. While the robot is tracking a single pose, the map is updated based on the SLAM framework. Experimental results show that the robot successfully localized itself robustly to disturbances including noises and kidnapping.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Sensor Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) is a standard method in many technical applications. Presented paper describes the usage of such approach in autonomous mobile robot navigation tasks. The FDI method uses pattern matching principle based on Markov chain theory. Such approach is capable to avoid any miss-readings or sensor failures during navigation task. This method significantly improves the robustness of mobile robot navigation in crowded environment shared with people. Practical verification experiments were performed on autonomous mobile robot Advee, which is designed to safely move among people.</td>
