<h1>About</h1>
<h4>My name is Selwan Ahmed Ali</h4>
<p>
They say that if you want something to be done well, do it yourself. So I follow this wise saying and would like to introduce myself. I believe that it isn't an easy thing to speak about yourself as it's hard to have a look at yourself from aside but at the same time who knows you better than you yourself do?
