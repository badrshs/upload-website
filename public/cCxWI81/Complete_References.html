	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper the proposed method aims to develop a low cost and efficient wall climbing robot that can climb on almost all surfaces. To ensure mechanical stability a centrifugal impeller is used and positioned above the robot that helps to generate an isolated low pressure area that makes adhesion to the vertical wall possible. When the impeller works, the sealing used in our robot reshapes to the shape of the contacting surface, maintaining the low pressure area inside which is a main advantage that eliminates the need for a perfect sealing as required by other vacuum powered wall climbing robots. To control the robot we use an ATmega8 micro controller along with RF wireless transceiver module and some discrete components. The experiment results verified the feasibility of the robot and it can make wall to floor and floor to wall transitions.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a real-time, low-cost system to localize a mobile robot in outdoor environments. Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion in real time (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman filter to prevent long-term drifts. Experimental results are presented for outdoor localization in moderately sized environments (ges100 meters)</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robotic swarms that take inspiration from nature are becoming a fascinating topic for multi-robot researchers. The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost, open-platform, autonomous micro-robot (Colias) for robotic swarm applications. Colias employs a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. It has a maximum speed of 35 cm/s which enables it to be used in swarm scenarios very quickly over large arenas. Long-range infrared modules with an adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours at a range of 0.5 cm to 2 m. Colias has been designed as a complete platform with supporting software development tools for robotics education and research. It has been tested in both individual and swarm scenarios, and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility for use as a micro-sized mobile robot and as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The amplitude response of infrared (IR) sensors based on reflected amplitude of the surrounding objects is non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. As a result, the main use of IR sensors in robotics is for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, their inherently fast response is very attractive for enhancing the real-time operation of a mobile robot in, for instance, map building tasks. Thus, it seems that the development of new low-cost IR sensors able to accurately measure distances with reduced response times is worth researching. In this paper, a new IR sensor based on the light intensity back-scattered from objects and able to measure distances of up to 1 m is described. Also, the sensor model is described and the expected errors in distance estimates are analysed and modelled. Finally, the experimental results obtained are discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Prosthetic hand control based on the acquisition and processing of surface electromyography signals (sEMG) is a well-established method that makes use of the electric potentials evoked by the physiological contraction processes of one or more muscles. Furthermore intelligent mobile medical devices are on the brink of introducing safe and highly sophisticated systems to help a broad patient community to regain a considerable amount of life quality. The major challenges which are inherent in such integrated system's design are mainly to be found in obtaining a compact system with a long mobile autonomy, capable of delivering the required signal requirements for EMG based prosthetic control with up to 32 simultaneous acquisition channels and - with an eye on a possible future exploitation as a medical device - a proper perspective on a low priced system. Therefore, according to these requirements we present a wireless, mobile platform for acquisition and communication of sEMG signals embedded into a complete mobile control system structure. This environment further includes a portable device such as a laptop providing the necessary computational power for the control and a commercially available robotic hand-prosthesis. Means of communication among those devices are based on the Bluetooth standard. We show, that the developed low cost mobile device can be used for proper prosthesis control and that the device can rely on a continuous operation for the usual daily life usage of a patient.</td>

It provides pressure measurements and shape information about the contact surfaces between the robot and the environment. The system is based on a mesh of sensors interconnected in order to form a networked structure. Each sensor has 12 capacitive taxels, has a triangular shape and is supported by a flexible substrate in order to conform to smooth curved surfaces. Three communications ports placed along the sides of each sensor sides allow communications with adjacent sensors. The tactile measurements are sent to embed microcontroller boards using serial bus communication links. The system can adaptively reduce its spatial resolution, improving the response time. This feature is very useful for detecting the first contact very rapidly, at a lower spatial resolution, and then increase the spatial resolution in the region of contact for accurate reconstruction of the contact pressure distribution.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Hyper-redundant manipulators can be fragile, expensive, and limited in their flexibility due to the distributed and bulky actuators that are typically used to achieve the precision and degrees of freedom (DOFs) required. Here, a manipulator is proposed that is robust, high-force, low-cost, and highly articulated without employing traditional actuators mounted at the manipulator joints. Rather, local tunable stiffness is coupled with off-board spooler motors and tension cables to achieve complex manipulator configurations. Tunable stiffness is achieved by reversible jamming of granular media, which-by applying a vacuum to enclosed grains-causes the grains to transition between solid-like states and liquid-like ones. Experimental studies were conducted to identify grains with high strength-to-weight performance. A prototype of the manipulator is presented with performance analysis, with emphasis on speed, strength, and articulation. This novel design for a manipulator-and use of jamming for robotic applications in general-could greatly benefit applications such as human-safe robotics and systems in which robots need to exhibit high flexibility to conform to their environments.</td>

This method allows a mobile robot equipped with a monocular camera to follow different naturally delimited paths. The contour shape can be used to calculate the forward and steering speed of the robot. To achieve real-time computation necessary for on-board execution in mobile robots, the image segmentation is implemented on a low-power embedded GPU.

The mechanism's monolithic, planar geometry is easily fabricated via planar manufacturing processes, enables compact packaging and incorporates a flexure mechanism for achieving small transmission ratios. The manipulator tolerates ±1 mm actuator misalignment with less than 0.1% full-scale position error. Measurements over a 100 nm × 100 nm × 100 nm work volume show resolution better than our measurement capability of 5 nm and open-loop parasitic errors less than 5 nm. Measurements over a 100 μm × 100 μm × 100 μm work volume show open loop errors less than 0.2% full-scale. The mechanism's equilateral symmetry and planar geometry make it possible to limit thermal drift in position and orientation to less than 23 nm and 4 μrad over a 30 min start up period. The nano-manipulator, built at US$ 2000 cost (excludes electronics), is used as an ultra-precision fiber optic aligner.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The continuing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a rapidly growing demand for mobile robots to be used during Explosive Ordnance Disposal operations. These robots are predominately used by EOD technicians for surveillance and neutralization of explosive threats from a safe standoff distance. The hazardous nature of the mission these vehicles help perform requires them to be expendable. Current commercially available systems, however, although capable of performing the mission, are costly and are not currently available in the large quantities needed by EOD technicians. The Naval EOD Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) proposes an alternative; a low cost, mobile robot using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts that is specifically tailored to perform hazardous EOD missions. The main functions of this robot are efficient surveillance and explosive threat neutralization. The use of COTS parts allows for streamlined field supportability and repair. A proposed speed of five miles per hour is a drastic improvement over many existing EOD robots and will allow EOD teams to quickly survey and assess potentially dangerous situations. The manipulator will be capable of precision placement of neutralization charges. The cost of this proposed robot is 10,000. Current commercial robots capable of performing these EOD tasks range in price from 40,000 to over $150,000. This conference paper will describe the robot design and prototyping process, from gathering requirements to fabrication and testing.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a framework for cooperative control of a group of nonholonomic mobile robots that allows us to build complex systems from simple controllers and estimators. The resultant modular approach is attractive because of the potential for reusability. Our approach to composition also guarantees stability and convergence in a wide range of tasks. There are two key features in our approach: 1) a paradigm for switching between simple decentralized controllers that allows for changes in formation; 2) the use of information from a single type of sensor, an omnidirectional camera, for all our controllers. We describe estimators that abstract the sensory information at different levels, enabling both decentralized and centralized cooperative control. Our results include numerical simulations and experiments using a testbed consisting of three nonholonomic robots.</td>

Our system is based on the use of two sensors: an odometer and an omnidirectional vision system which gives a reference in connection with a set of natural beacons. Our navigation algorithm gives a reliable position estimation due to a systematic dynamic resetting. To merge the data obtained we use the extended Kalman filter. Our proposed method allows us to treat efficiently the noise problems linked to the primitive extraction, which contributes to the robustness of our system. Thus, we have developed a reliable and quick navigation system which can deals with the constraints of moving the robots in an industrial environment.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification of the environment to function properly, and those that work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization. In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method based on the CONDENSATION algorithm, a Bayesian filtering method that uses a sampling-based density representation. We show how the CONDENSATION algorithm can be rued in a novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the environment. Based on these two observations, we present a vision-based robot localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the viability of our approach, we show both global localization and tracking results in the context of a state of the art robotics application</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Autism Spectrum Disorder impacts an ever-increasing number of children. The disorder is marked by social functioning that is characterized by impairment in the use of nonverbal behaviors, failure to develop appropriate peer relationships and lack of social and emotional exchanges. Providing early intervention through the modality of play therapy has been effective in improving behavioral and social outcomes for children with autism. Interacting with humanoid robots that provide simple emotional response and interaction has been shown to improve the communication skills of autistic children. In particular, early intervention and continuous care provide significantly better outcomes. Currently, there are no robots capable of meeting these requirements that are both low-cost and available to families of autistic children for in-home use. This paper proposes the piloting the use of robotics as an improved diagnostic and early intervention tool for autistic children that is affordable, non-threatening, durable, and capable of interacting with an autistic child. This robot has the ability to track the child with its 3 degree of freedom (DOF) eyes and 3-DOF head, open and close its 1-DOF beak and 1-DOF each eyelids, raise its 1-DOF each wings, play sound, and record sound. These attributes will give it the ability to be used for the diagnosis and treatment of autism. As part of this project, the robot and the electronic and control software have been developed, and integrating semi-autonomous interaction, teleoperation from a remote healthcare provider and initiating trials with children in a local clinic are in progress.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A global localization system combining odometry data with radio frequency identification (RFID) readings is proposed. RFID tags are placed at the ceiling of the environment and can be detected by a mobile robot unit traveling below them. The detection of the tags is the only information used in the proposed approach (no distance or bearing to the tag is considered available), but differently from similar localization setups reported in the literature, only a small number (about one each square meter or less) of tags are used. This is possible using a suitable tag's antenna in ultrahigh frequency band, expressly designed to obtain regular and stable RFID detection regions, which allows us to consider an efficient Kalman filtering approach to fuse RFID readings with the vehicle odometry data. A satisfactory performance is achieved, with an average position error of about 0.1 m. The hardware/software localization setup described in this paper is cheap and easy to use and may provide a satisfactory approach in several industrial and domestic scenarios.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new method for improving the accuracy of inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on land vehicles. The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Providing contact sensing on the whole body of a robot is a key feature to increase the safety level of physical human-robot interaction. In this paper, a new robot skin capable of sensing multiple contact locations is presented. The motivation behind the proposed design is to produce a relatively inexpensive skin having the capability to provide the spatial location of collisions and also to add compliance to the robot's external cover. The resulting device is a thin flexible sensor sheet made of polyimide films with electrically conductive ink and a pressure sensitive conductive rubber sheet. The problem of internal wire routing is circumvented by the use of conductive ink and a circuit is proposed to minimize the number of output wires. To provide collision absorption and mechanical robustness, the sensor is embedded in different layers of polyurethane using shape deposition manufacturing (SDM). The paper presents the design and the fabrication process of the skin but also some experimental results on the determination of the mechanical properties of the resulting sensor as well as its potential for increasing human safety during human robot interaction.</td>

However, the sheer size of these unstructured environments (for example Australia's Great Barrier Reef) pose a number of challenges for current monitoring platforms which are typically remote operated and required significant resources and infrastructure. Therefore, a primary objective of the CSIRO robotic reef monitoring project is to develop and deploy a large number of AUV teams to perform broadscale reef surveying. In order to achieve this, the platforms must be cheap, even possibly disposable. This work presents the results of a preliminary investigation into the performance of a low-cost sensor suite and associated processing techniques for vision and inertial-based navigation within a highly unstructured reef environment.</td>

The camera is mounted on-board a quadrotor helicopter. Camera pose estimation is based on the appearance of two concentric circles which are used as landmark. We show that that by using a calibrated camera, conic sections, and the assumption that yaw is controlled independently, it is possible to determine the six degrees-of-freedom pose of the MAV. First we show how to detect the landmark in the image frame. Then we present a geometric approach for camera pose estimation from the elliptic appearance of a circle in perspective projection. Using this information we are able to determine the pose of the vehicle. Finally, given a set point in the image frame we are able to control the quadrotor such that the feature appears in the respective target position. The performance of the proposed method is presented through experimental results.</td>

Furthermore, our system can also be used for free-hand reconstruction of detailed 3-D models. In addition to the system itself, we present a thorough experimental evaluation on a publicly available benchmark dataset. We analyze and discuss the influence of several parameters such as the choice of the feature descriptor, the number of visual features, and validation methods. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our system can robustly deal with challenging scenarios such as fast camera motions and feature-poor environments while being fast enough for online operation. Our system is fully available as open source and has already been widely adopted by the robotics community.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we present a small, light-weight, low-cost, fast and reliable system designed to satisfy requirements of relative localization within a swarm of micro aerial vehicles. The core of the proposed solution is based on off-the-shelf components consisting of the Caspa camera module and Gumstix Overo board accompanied by a developed efficient image processing method for detecting black and white circular patterns. Although the idea of the roundel recognition is simple, the developed system exhibits reliable and fast estimation of the relative position of the pattern up to 30 fps using the full resolution of the Caspa camera. Thus, the system is suited to meet requirements for a vision based stabilization of the robotic swarm. The intent of this paper is to present the developed system as an enabling technology for various robotic tasks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, an adaptive and low-cost robotic coating platform for small production series is presented. This new platform presents a flexible architecture that enables fast/automatic system adaptive behaviour without human intervention. The concept is based on contactless technology, using artificial vision and laser scanning to identify and characterize different workpieces travelling on a conveyor. Using laser triangulation, the workpieces are virtually reconstructed through a simplified cloud of three-dimensional (3D) points. From those reconstructed models, several algorithms are implemented to extract information about workpieces profile (pattern recognition), size, boundary and pose. Such information is then used to on-line adjust the ``base'' robot programmes. These robot programmes are off-line generated from a 3D computer-aided design model of each different workpiece profile. Finally, the robotic manipulator executes the coating process after its ``base'' programmes have been adjusted. This is a low-cost and fully autonomous system that allows adapting the robot's behaviour to different manufacturing situations. It means that the robot is ready to work over any piece at any time, and thus, small production series can be reduced to as much as a one-object series. No skilled workers and large setup times are needed to operate it. Experimental results showed that this solution proved to be efficient and can be applied not only for spray coating purposes but also for many other industrial processes (automatic manipulation, pick-and-place, inspection, etc.).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For mobile robots to be successful, they have to navigate safely in populated and dynamic environments. While recent research has led to a variety of localization methods that can track robots well in static environments, we still lack methods that can robustly localize mobile robots in dynamic environ- ments, in which people block the robot’s sensors for extensive periods of time or the position of furniture may change. This paper proposes extensions to Markov localization algorithms enabling them to localize mobile robots even in densely pop- ulated environments. Two different filters for determining the “believability” of sensor readings are employed. These fil- ters are designed to detect sensor readings that are corrupted by humans or unexpected changes in the environment. The technique was recently implemented and applied as part of an installation, in which a mobile robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the “Deutsches Museum Bonn.” Extensive empiri- cal tests involving datasets recorded during peak traffic hours in the museum demonstrate that this approach is able to accu- rately estimate the robot’s position in more than 98% of the cases even in such highly dynamic environments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We present a low-cost explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) robot, which grew out of a collaboration between Villanova University (VU) and the Golden West Humanitarian Foundation (GWHF). Unexploded ordnance (UXO) are commonplace in the developing world. Ideally, the handling of UXO would be carried out using EOD robots, like those employed by the US military. However, these devices are cost prohibitive for developing world governments and municipalities and, perhaps, not ideally suited for deployment by them. The low-cost EOD bot described in this paper, was conceived with the developing world in mind through a series of senior design projects and was designed to maintain functionality (e.g. ability to lift and drag heavy loads, place charges, etc.) while reducing cost. This is achieved through well thought out design tradeoffs and the use of lower-cost hardware. The general design of this robot, a discussion of design tradeoffs, and preliminary field tests are presented.</td>

The goal is to have N mobile robots establish and maintain some predetermined geometric shape. We report results from extensive simulation experiments, and 40+ experiments with four physical robots, showing the viability of our approach. The key idea is that each robot keeps a single friend at a desired angle θ, using some appropriate sensor. By panning the sensor by θ degrees, the goal for all formations becomes simply to center the friend in the sensor's field of view. We also present a general analytical measure for evaluating formations and apply it to the position data from both simulation and physical robot experiments. We used two lasers to track the physical robots to obtain ground truth validation data.</td>

Taking advantage of plenty of open source packages in the ROS and Intel cutting edge perceptual computing software, this social robot system allows researchers and school students to rapidly reproduce an affordable and ideal hardware/software platform for their robotics-related research and education.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Knowledge of position in the context of its surrounding is necessary for robots to build maps and develop path plans. Limitations in odometry and the lack of a priori knowledge reduce the effectiveness of a single robot to retain a sense of position for any extended duration. The problem is only compounded when the scale of the robot is reduced. However, by employing multiple robots we can exploit their distributed nature to provide an external context in which to evaluate sensor readings for mapping and localization. We have designed a team of centimeter-sized robots that coordinate sensing and action to establish and maintain position as they move throughout space. By utilizing low-cost ultrasonic sensors, the team is able to measure the range between each robot pair. We pose these measurements in terms of a position likelihood and combine them to find a global solution that best maximizes the position likelihood of each robot. We also address a unique multipath interference mode that arises as a direct result of the reduced scale of the robot team. We present our experiences with localization and control of a small robot team</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an efficient localization scheme for an indoors mobile robot using Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems. The mobile robot carries an RFID reader at the bottom of the chassis, which reads the RFID tags on the floor to localize the mobile robot. Each of the RFID tags stores its own absolute position, which is used to calculate the position, orientation, and velocity of the mobile robot. However, a localization system based on RFID technology inevitably suffers from an estimation error. In this paper, a new triangular pattern of arranging the RFID tags on the floor has been proposed to reduce the estimation error of the conventional square pattern. In addition, the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot has been utilized to improve the localization accuracy of the mobile robot. According to the conventional approach, two readers are necessary to identify the orientation of the mobile robot. Therefore, this new approach, based on the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot, provides a cheap and fast estimation of the orientation. The proposed algorithms used to raise the accuracy of the robot localization are successfully verified through experiments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: GPS and low-cost INS sensors are widely used for positioning and attitude determination applications. Low-cost inertial sensors exhibit large errors that can be compensated using position and velocity updates from GPS. Combining both sensors using a Kalman filter provides high-accuracy, real-time navigation. A conventional Kalman filter relies on the correct definition of the measurement and process noise matrices, which are generally defined a priori and remain fixed throughout the processing run. Adaptive Kalman filtering techniques use the residual sequences to adapt the stochastic properties of the filter on line to correspond to the temporal dependence of the errors involved. This paper examines the use of three adaptive filtering techniques. These are artificially scaling the predicted Kalman filter covariance, the Adaptive Kalman Filter and Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation. The algorithms are tested with the GPS and inertial data simulation software. A trajectory taken from a real marine trial is used to test the dynamic alignment of the inertial sensor errors. Results show that on line estimation of the stochastic properties of the inertial system can significantly improve the speed of the dynamic alignment and potentially improve the overall navigation accuracy and integrity.</td>

The oversampled A/D converter can reduce the quantization errors and improve the scales to fit for the low-cost SINS. The effect of oversampling was analyzed, not only in reducing quantization errors and signal noise, but also in improving integral filtering precision. The DPS+FPGA structure was used to collect the six signals of gyros and accelerometers in high speed and parallel mode. The experiment results show that, the low-cost SINS using the oversampled A/D converter have good performance in common integrate navigation applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For the guidance, control and navigation of autonomous vehicles, both positioning and orientation are important for mission success and surveillance. Global positioning system (GPS) and strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) have complementary characteristics to overcome the demerits of each other and can well perform as integrated navigation system. The observability analysis of low-cost SINS/GPS from many researches shown that the heading and yaw rate gyro bias is unobservable in straight motion and with constant acceleration. This paper presents integration of low-cost SINS/GPS aided with odometer and heading from two antennae GPS receiver to overcome this problem and to control the accuracy degradation during GPS outage. The carrier phase measurements are processed to obtain the heading from two antennae position measurement. The obtained heading and position from GPS and velocity measurement from odometer are used as observation input to extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the heading and positioning accuracy improvement of SINS/odometer/GPS integrated system for land vehicle navigation. When GPS signal is unavailable, the filter switches to SINS/odometer integration to control the position and velocity errors growth during this period. The observation model for heading measurement from two antennae is derived for the designed system. A field test was conducted to check the effectiveness using proposed method for heading and positioning accuracy improvement. The test results showed that Low-cost IMU/Odometer/ Two Antennae GPS integrated systems' accuracy both in position and heading is improved significantly.</td>

In particular, the goal was to realize: 1) soft; 2) robust; 3) small; and 4) low-cost sensors that can be easily fabricated and integrated on robotic devices that interact with the environment. We targeted a number of desired features, the most important being: 1) high sensitivity; 2) low hysteresis; and 3) repeatability. The sensor consists of a silicone body in which a small magnet is immersed; an Hall-effect sensor placed below the silicone body measures the magnetic field generated by the magnet, which changes when the magnet is displaced due to an applied external pressure. Two different versions of the sensor have been manufactured, characterized, and mounted on an anthropomorphic robotic hand. Experiments, in which the hand interacts with real-world objects, are reported.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The goal of our work is to provide a fast and accurate method to estimate the camera motion from RGB-D images. Our approach registers two consecutive RGB-D frames directly upon each other by minimizing the photometric error. We estimate the camera motion using non-linear minimization in combination with a coarse-to-fine scheme. To allow for noise and outliers in the image data, we propose to use a robust error function that reduces the influence of large residuals. Furthermore, our formulation allows for the inclusion of a motion model which can be based on prior knowledge, temporal filtering, or additional sensors like an IMU. Our method is attractive for robots with limited computational resources as it runs in real-time on a single CPU core and has a small, constant memory footprint. In an extensive set of experiments carried out both on a benchmark dataset and synthetic data, we demonstrate that our approach is more accurate and robust than previous methods. We provide our software under an open source license.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Low-cost but high performance robot arms are required for widespread use of service robots. Most robot arms use expensive motors and speed reducers to provide torques sufficient to support the robot mass and payload. If the gravitational torques due to the robot mass, which is usually much greater than the payload, can be compensated by some means, the robot would need much smaller torques, which can be delivered by cheap actuator modules. To this end, we propose a counterbalance mechanism which can completely counterbalance the gravitational torques due to the robot mass. Since most 6 DOF robots have 3 pitch joints, which are subject to gravitational torques due to the robot mass, we propose a 3 DOF counterbalance mechanism based on the double parallelogram mechanism, in which reference planes are provided to each joint for proper counterbalancing. A 5 DOF counterbalance robot arm was built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mechanism. Simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed mechanism had effectively decreased the torque required to support the robot mass, thus allowing the prospective use of low-cost motors and speed reducers for high performance root arms.</td>

The 3D model of the robot's environment is built using a professional freeware computer graphics tool named Blender and pre-stored in the memory of the robot's on-board computer. Estimation of the mobile robot pose as a stochastic variable is done by correspondences of image lines, extracted using Random Window Randomized Hough Transform line detection algorithm, and model lines, predicted using odometry readings and 3D environment model. The camera model and ray tracing algorithm are also described. Developed algorithms are experimentally tested using a Pioneer 2DX mobile robot.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For complex robotic tasks (e.g., manipulation, locomotion), the lack of knowledge of precise interaction models, the difficulties to precisely measure the task associated physical quantities (e.g., position of contact points, interaction forces) in real-time, the finite sampling time of digital control loops and the non-collocation of sensors and transducers have negative effects on performance and stability of robots when using simple force or simple movement controllers. To cope with these issues, a new compact design for high performance actuators specifically adapted for integration in robotic mechanisms is presented. This design makes use of a mechanical differential as its central element. Results shown that differential coupling between an intrinsically high impedance transducer and an intrinsically low impedance mechanical spring provides the same benefits as serial coupling, but in a more compact and simple design. This new actuator, named Differential Elastic Actuator (DEA), provides interesting design implementations, especially for rotational actuators used for mobile robot locomotion.</td>

The tilt sensor uses an internal pendulum and therefore has its own slow dynamics. These sensor dynamics were identified experimentally and combined to achieve high-bandwidth measurements using an optimal linear state estimator. Potential uses of the measurement technique range from robotics, to rehabilitation, to vehicle control.</td>

This prototype is designed to provide mobile robot swarms with advanced sensing capabilities in an efficient, cost-effective way. From the observation of bats' foraging behaviors, the prototype with a particular emphasis on variable rotation range and speed, as well as 360° observation capability has been developed. The prototype also aims at giving each robot reliable information about identification of neighboring robots from objects and their positions. For this purpose, an observation algorithm-based sensor is proposed. The implementation details are explained, and the effectiveness of the control schemes is verified through extensive experiments. The sensor provides real-time location of stationary targets positioned 100 cm away within an average error of 2.6 cm. Moreover, experimental results show that the prototype observation capability can be quite satisfactory for practical use of mobile robot swarms.</td>

This paper proposed an intrusion detection algorithm based on collecting light signal and a counter-based routing protocol integrated with Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). The counter-based routing protocol makes use of a randomized delay before a data transmission to reduce data redundancy. This provides a lightweight solution while preserving the advantage of being an easily implementable protocol. Furthermore, an event-based interface to facilitate handshaking between the new routing protocol and the proposed lightweight motion detection algorithm is defined to realize the intrusion detection application. The detection algorithm and the routing protocol are implemented in a prototypical wireless sensor network using MICA2 sensor motes.</td>

In situations where robots and humans are interacting or working together, humanoid robots can better navigate human environments and make humans more comfortable with their appearance. Until recently, most humanoid robots were custom-made and designed for one specific environment. The development of open-source, low-cost humanoid robotics platforms, such as Trossen's HR-OS1, provide skeleton platforms that can be developed for mass use in environments with extensive human-robot interaction, such as retail settings. With this future in mind, the base HR-OS1 platform was modified with additional hardware and a new software framework to give it the navigation and communication skills required to be a personal attendant. This design can serve as a model for a humanoid robot in other settings where human-robot interaction is advantageous.</td>

WCR climbs on the surface of window glass by means of four suction cups, and wipes the surface simultaneously with a rotational wiper. WCR is characterized as lightweight and mini-size. In the robot, two beams are set close to the rear and the forward of the main body. The suction cups are positioned at both sides of each beam. These cups function as legs for locomotion. Two pairs of cups in diagonal position suck alternately on the surface of window when the robot moves. The basic characteristics and results of gauge pressure in suction cups are presented. In addition, the position of gravitational center of the robot coincides with the midpoint of the sucking cups. After successful moving on the vertical window glass without dropping, cleaning function was checked by the artificial stain.</td>

Moreover it behaves sensibly in the presence of acceleration and magnetic disturbances. Experimental comparisons with a commercial device illustrate its good performance; an implementation on an 8-bit microcontroller with very limited processing power demonstrates its computational simplicity.</td>

This paper presents our preliminary work on the robot design and our experience using it to teach an introductory engineering class. The hardware can support classes in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The low-cost and small size will enable more research groups to perform multi-robot experiments on physical hardware.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-robot manipulation allows for scalable environmental interaction, which is critical for multi-robot systems to have an impact on our world. A successful manipulation model requires cost-effective robots, robust hardware, and proper system feedback and control. This paper details key sensing and manipulator capabilities of the r-one robot. The r-one robot is an advanced, open source, low-cost platform for multi-robot manipulation and sensing that meets all of these requirements. The parts cost is around $250 per robot. The r-one has a rich sensor suite, including a flexible IR communication/localization/obstacle detection system, high-precision quadrature encoders, gyroscope, accelerometer, integrated bump sensor, and light sensors. Two years of working with these robots inspired the development of an external manipulator that gives the robots the ability to interact with their environment. This paper presents an overview of the r-one, the r-one manipulator, and basic manipulation experiments to illustrate the efficacy our design. The advanced design, low cost, and small size can support university research with large populations of robots and multi-robot curriculum in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. We conclude with remarks on the future implementation of the manipulators and expected work to follow.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes the experiences of using an advanced, low-cost robot in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. It presents three innovations: It is a powerful, cheap, robust, and small advanced personal robot; it forms the foundation of a problem-based learning curriculum; and it enables a novel multi-robot curriculum while fostering collaborative team work on assignments. The robot design has many features specific to educators: It is advanced enough for academic research, has a broad feature set to support a wide range of curricula, and is inexpensive enough to be an effective outreach tool. The low cost allows each student to have their own robot for the semester, so they can work on activities outside the classroom. This robot was used in three different classes in which it was the foundation for an innovative problem-based learning curriculum. In particular, the robot has specialized sensors and a communications system that supports novel multi-robot curricula, which encourage student interaction in new ways. The results are promising; the robot was a big success in graduate, undergraduate, and outreach activities. Finally, student assessments indicate a greater interest and understanding of engineering and other STEM majors, and class evaluations were consistently above average.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Flexible automation systems provide the needed adaptability to serve shorter-term projects and specialty applications in biochemical analysis. A low-cost selective compliant articulated robotic arm designed for liquid spillage avoidance is developed here. In the vertical-plane robotic arm movement test, the signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and accelerometer were able to sense collisions. In the horizontal movement test, however, only the signals from the IMU enabled collision to be detected. Using a calculation method developed, it was possible to chart the regions where the obstacle was likely to be located when a collision occurred. The low cost of the IMU and its easy incorporation into the robotic arm offer the potential to meet the pressures of lowering operating costs, apply laboratory automation in resource-limited venues, and obviate human intervention in response to sudden disease outbreaks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we focus on configuring a low cost RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) system with less RFID readers and low density RFID tag textiles for stable and accurate self-localization for an omni-directional mobile robot. An RFID system using multiple RFID readers and high density RFID tags has already been applied to an indoor mobile robot self-localization. However, the system production cost is relatively high. To reduce the production cost of the system while maintaining the self-localization performance, we redesign two new RFID systems configured with 20 RFID readers and 5 RFID readers enlarging the size of an RFID reader antenna. Particularly, a new likelihood function of the tag detection with the redesigned large size RFID reader antenna is proposed for Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). Furthermore, we come up with a novel arrangement of RFID tags installed in a hexagon pattern. The new arrangement of ID tags enables both low cost ID tag installation and high performance of self-localization. We examine the performances of robot self-localization with less RFID readers and lower density RFID tags installed on the floor based on MCL(Monte Carlo localization). The simulation demonstrates the validity of our proposed configuration of the RFID based self-localization.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The ability to control compliance of robotic joints is desirable because the resulting robotic mechanisms can adapt to varying task requirements and can take advantage of natural limb and joint dynamics. The implementation of controllable compliance in robots, however, is often constrained by the inherent instability of active compliance meth- ods and by the limited availability of the custom, nonlinear springs needed by passive compliance methods. This work overcomes a major limitation of passive compliance by producing designs for two novel mechanisms capable of generating a wide variety of specifiable, nonlinear elastic relationships. One of these designs is physically imple- mented as a quadratic “spring” and is used to create a passively compliant robot joint with series-elastic actuation. A simple feed-forward algorithm is then experimentally shown to be sufficient to control independently and simultaneously both joint angle and joint compliance, regardless of the presence of external forces on the joint. We believe that this is the first physically constructed system to use antagonistic quadratic springs to successfully demonstrate open-loop, independent, and simultaneous control of both joint angle and joint stiffness. Because this approach better emulates the underlying joint mechanics used by animals, it may improve both the quality and variety of robotic movements.</td>

Given the fast growing technological progress in these fields, robots can offer a wide range of applications. However real world integration and application development for such a distributed system composed of many robotic modules and networked robotic devices is very difficult. Therefore, middleware services provide a novel approach offering many possibilities and drastically enhancing the application development for robots. This paper surveys the current state of middleware approaches in this domain. It discusses middleware challenges in these systems and presents some representative middleware solutions specifically designed for robots.

The problem of localization, i.e., de- termining where a given node is physically located in a network is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applica- tions. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS (Global Positioning System) on all nodes in these networks. In this paper, we review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity-metric method for localization in outdoor environ- ments that makes use of the inherent radio-frequency (RF) communi- cations capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, that is more ro- bust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then depen- dent on the separation distance between two adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimen- tal results show that the accuracy for 90&percnt; of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.</td>

The hardware implementation of the proposed detection system uses two Sharp GP2D02 infra-red range sensors which are placed cross over each other in front of the robot in order to detect any object and avoid collisions. The software implementation of the proposed detection system is implemented using timer with the overflow interrupt for generating the required waveform for driving the Sharp GP2D02 infra-red range sensor. As a result, the mobile robot is able to execute different tasks without a delay on the processing time, for example driving the robot wheels and drive the Sharp sensors for detecting an object. Experimental results show that the proposed detection system successfully detect an object placed in a path of the mobile robot.</td>

In this paper we present LANDMARC, a location sensing prototype system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for locating objects inside buildings. The major advantage of LANDMARC is that it improves the overall accuracy of locating objects by utilizing the concept of reference tags. Based on experimental analysis, we demonstrate that active RFID is a viable and cost-effective candidate for indoor location sensing. Although RFID is not designed for indoor location sensing, we point out three major features that should be added to make RFID technologies competitive in this new and growing market.</td>

The skin is organized as a network of self-contained modules consisting of tiny pressure-sensitive elements which communicate through a serial bus. By adding or removing modules it is possible to adjust the area covered by the skin as well as the number (and density) of tactile elements. The skin is therefore highly modular and thus intrinsically scalable. Moreover, because the substrate on which the modules are mounted is sufficiently pliable to be folded and stiff enough to be cut, it is possible to freely distribute the individual tactile elements. A tactile skin composed of multiple modules can also be installed on curved surfaces. Due to their easy configurability we call our sensors "cut-and-paste tactile sensors." We describe a prototype implementation of the skin on a humanoid robot</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a distributed particle filter algorithm for localizing multiple mobile robots that are equipped only with low cost/low power sensors. This method is applicable to multi-micro robot systems, where size limitations restrict sensor selection (e.g. small infrared range finders). Localization of three robots in a known environment is conducted by combining measurements from a small number of simple range sensors with inter-robot distances obtained through an acoustic range finder system. The localization problem is formulated as estimating the global position and orientation of a single triangle, where corners of the triangle represent the positions of robots. The robot positions relative to the centroid of the triangle are then determined by trilateration using the inter-robot distance measurements. Each robot uses an identical particle filter algorithm to estimate the global position of the triangle. The best estimates determined by each particle filter are distributed among the robots for use in the following iteration. Simulations demonstrate the ability to perform global localization of three robots, each using a compass and two range finders. The results illustrate that this method can globally localize the robot team in a simulated indoor environment The results are compared to simulations where robots have access to only their own sensor data, which are unable to successfully localize under equivalent conditions.</td>

Although there are several commercial mobile robots available for these tasks, they are often costly, do not always meet the characteristics needed for certain applications and are very difficult to adapt because they have proprietary software and hardware. In this paper, we present the design principles, and describe the development and applications of a mobile robot called ExaBot. Our main goal was to obtain a single multi-purpose low-cost robot -more than ten times cheaper than commercially available platforms- that can be used not only for research, but also for education and public outreach activities. The body of the ExaBot, its sensors, actuators, processing units and control board are described in detail. The software and printed circuit board developed for this project are open source to allow the robotics community to use and upgrade the current version. Finally, different configurations of the ExaBot are presented, showing several applications that fulfill the requirements this robotic platform was designed for. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, mechanical design and implementation of a low-cost and lightweight inflatable robot finger are proposed. The proposed soft inflatable robot finger is different from traditional designs. It uses a common and low cost inflatable material and can be easily and massively manufactured. The proposed soft inflatable finger only weighs 0.8 grams, but can well realize swift movement which is actuated by low pressure air. Numerous analyses and experiments have been conducted for key parameters selection of the mechanical design. The performances of the proposed finger including flexing and extending have also been evaluated, and results are satisfactory.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>:  When service robots work in human environments, unexpected and unknown moving people may deteriorate the convergence of robot localization or even cause failure localization if the environment is crowded. In this article, a multisensor observation localizability estimation method is proposed and implemented for supporting reliable robot localization in unstructured environments with low-cost sensors. The contribution of the approach is a strategy that combines noisy laser range-finder data and RGB-D data for estimating the dynamic localizability matrix in a probabilistic framework. By aligning two sensor frames, the unreliable part of the laser readings that hits unexpected moving people is fast extracted according to the output of a RGB-D-based human detector, so that the influence of unexpected moving people on laser observations can be explicitly factored out. The method is easy for implementation and is highly desirable to ensure robustness and real-time performance for long-term operation in populated environments. Comparative experiments are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method in improving the localization accuracy and reliability in dynamic environments. </td>

The arm is unique in that it achieves reasonable performance for the envisioned tasks (backlash-free, sub-3mm repeatability, moves at 1.5m/s, 2kg payload) but with a significantly lower parts cost than comparable manipulators. The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth. The arm is used to demonstrate pancake cooking (pouring batter, flipping pancakes), using the intrinsic compliance of the arm to aid in interaction with objects.</td>

Instead of using an absolute positioning approach with fixed beacons in the operating environment, we have developed a ultrasonic relative positioning system that allows each robot to perceive the distance and the angle of other nearby robots in relation to its own position. The system is based on time-of-flight evaluation of ultrasonic pulses and a RF communication link. The system has a precision of 8 mm and of 3deg over a 6.7 m range.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot manipulator designs are increasingly focused on low cost approaches, especially those envisioned for use in unstructured environments such as households, office spaces and hazardous environments. The cost of angular sensors varies based on the precision offered. For tasks in these environments, millimeter order manipulation errors are unlikely to cause drastic reduction in performance. In this paper, estimates the joint angles of a manipulator using low cost triaxial accelerometers by taking the difference between consecutive acceleration vectors. The accelerometer-based angle is compensated with a uniaxial gyroscope using a complementary filter to give robust measurements. Three compensation strategies are compared: complementary filter, time varying complementary filter, and extended Kalman filter. This sensor setup can also accurately track the joint angle even when the joint axis is parallel to gravity and the accelerometer data does not provide useful information. In order to analyze this strategy, accelerometers and gyroscopes were mounted on one arm of a PR2 robot. The arm was manually moved smoothly through different trajectories in its workspace while the joint angle readings from the on-board optical encoders were compared against the joint angle estimates from the accelerometers and gyroscopes. The low cost angle estimation strategy has a mean error 1.3° over the three joints estimated, resulting in mean end effector position errors of 6.1 mm or less. This system provides an effective angular measurement as an alternative to high precision encoders in low cost manipulators and as redundant measurements for safety in other manipulators.</td>

These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.</td>

This paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost air muscle actuated humanoid hand developed at Curtin University of Technology. This hand offers 10 individually controllable degrees of freedom ranging from the elbow to the fingers, with overall control handled through a computer GUI. The hand is actuated through 20 McKibben-style air muscles, each supplied by a pneumatic pressure-balancing valve that allows for proportional control to be achieved with simple and inexpensive components.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robotics research and education have gained significant attention in recent years due to increased development and commercial deployment of industrial and service robots. A majority of researchers working on robot grasping and object manipulation tend to utilize commercially available robot-manipulators equipped with various end effectors for experimental studies. However, commercially available robotic grippers are often expensive and are not easy to modify for specific purposes. To extend the choice of robotic end effectors freely available to researchers and educators, we present an open-source low-cost three-finger robotic gripper platform for research and educational purposes. The 3-D design model of the gripper is presented and manufactured with a minimal number of 3-D-printed components and an off-the-shelf servo actuator. An underactuated finger and gear train mechanism, with an overall gripper assembly design, are described in detail, followed by illustrations and a discussion of the gripper grasping performance and possible gripper platform modifications. The presented open-source gripper platform computer-aided design model is released for downloading on the authors research lab website (<;uri xlink:href="http://www.alaris.kz" xlink:type="simple">www.alaris.kz<;/uri>) and can be utilized by robotics researchers and educators as a design platform to build their own robotic end effector solutions for research and educational purposes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The McKibben artificial muscle is a pneumatic device characterized by its high level of functional analogy with human skeletal muscle. While maintaining a globally cylindrical shape, the McKibben muscle produces a contraction force decreasing with its contraction ratio, as does skeletal muscle. The maximum force-to-weight ratio can be surprisingly high for a limited radial dimension and for a conventional pressure range. A 50 g McKibben muscle can easily develop more than 1000 N under 5 bar pressure for an external radius varying from about 1.5 to 3 cm. Thus, robotics specialists are interested in this well-adapted artificial muscle for motorizing powerful yet compact robot arms. The basic McKibben muscle static modeling developed in the paper, which is based on the three main parameters (i.e., initial braid angle, initial muscle length, and initial muscle radius) and includes a three-parameter friction model of the thread against itself, has shown its efficiency in both isometric and isotonic contraction</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As robots and humans move towards sharing the same environment, the need for safety in robotic systems is of growing importance. Towards this goal of human-friendly robotics, a robust, low-cost, low-noise capacitive force sensing array is presented with application as a whole body artificial skin covering. This highly scalable design provides excellent noise immunity, low-hysteresis, and has the potential to be made flexible and formable. Noise immunity is accomplished through the use of shielding and local sensor processing. A small and low-cost multivibrator circuit is replicated locally at each taxel, minimizing stray capacitance and noise coupling. Each circuit has a digital pulse train output, which allows robust signal transmission in noisy electrical environments. Wire count is minimized through serial or row-column addressing schemes, and the use of an open-drain output on each taxel allows hundreds of sensors to require only a single output wire. With a small set of interface wires, large arrays can be scanned hundreds of times per second and dynamic response remains flat over a broad frequency range. Sensor performance is evaluated on a bench-top version of a 4 × 4 taxel array in quasi-static and dynamic cases.</td>

In this paper the typical problems of sonar based autonomous navigation and the authors' solutions to overcome them are discussed. The authors have created, robust modules for sonar data fusion and safe steering which significantly improve known methods. There are furthermore robot control behaviors which offer specific competence to solve high-level tasks. These behaviors build a hierarchical architecture but have the ability to assess their respective task and autonomously suggest a different, more competent behavior to continue. Thus, the behaviors work together as distributed competencies. The concept described here is being evaluated in a system on the authors' experimental robot ROAMER.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper concerns the development of robot skin capable of accurately sensing the location of objects in area contact with the skin surface. There has been no report on tactile sensing which attained not only skin deformation detection but also contact object location sensing with high accuracy. In the category of optomechatronics technology, we apply optical fibers to transmit surface deformation information of soft skin for sensing the location of an object in contact with the soft skin accurately. In the paper, we illustrate the structure of the robot skin, and describe the principle of both detecting the position of the reflector chips and sensing the contact location of an object. The robot skin is characterized by the fact that the surface is low cost and easily replacable, and the sensing performance is robust against any electromagnetic disturbance. We then show experimental results for verifying the principles using a wedge-shaped object. For evaluating the sensing accuracy, comparisons are made: 1) between the location of a real convex of the object and that of the corresponding estimated polygon and 2) for the position of two vertices of the object when independent fitting and Lagrangian fitting methods are applied.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Modular, self-reconfigurable robots show the promise of great versatility, robustness and low cost. The paper presents examples and issues in realizing those promises. PolyBot is a modular, self-reconfigurable system that is being used to explore the hardware reality of a robot with a large number of interchangeable modules. PolyBot has demonstrated the versatility promise, by implementing locomotion over a variety of terrain and manipulation versatility with a variety of objects. PolyBot is the first robot to demonstrate sequentially two topologically distinct locomotion modes by self-reconfiguration. PolyBot has raised issues regarding software scalability and hardware dependency and as the design evolves the issues of low cost and robustness will be resolved while exploring the potential of modular, self-reconfigurable robots</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For the high-speed and light Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), it is moving freely, and the speed and attitude are in dynamic movement. And for the micro electromechanical system (MEMS) technology based low-cost strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), over too large bias drift errors not only made the system functions nonlinear, but also made the estimation for misalignment angle converge to a false value. Therefore, this paper concerns the MEMS-based low-cost SINS initial alignment under the dynamic movement with large initial error. A nonlinear mathematics model of SINS initial alignment has been derived. The nonlinear filter unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is investigated in the nonlinear system to estimate the initial attitude and the MEMS sensor biases simultaneously. The simulation indicated that the algorithm is suitable for initial alignment.</td>

Location information in outdoor application can be easily obtained from well-known systems such as GPS and GLONASS. Since GPS signal is not available in indoor area, several positioning systems have been developed for. But there is not a consensus for indoor positioning systems like the outdoor. In this study, a positioning system that uses ultrasonic and infrared signals is designed and implemented. The system is tested in 4m2 coverage range and it is observed that the maximum absolute error is less than +/-2 cm.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot fabrication has always been a costly matter. Even for educational purposes, one will need to spend substantial amount of money for building single robot with limited capabilities. When it comes to development of higher capabilities and intelligence, more investment will be required. In this paper, we present details of a mobile robot that is specially designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in a swarm of robots. This robot can navigate outdoor autonomously based on a digital compass, GPS module and a transceiver module to communicate with other robots and a base station as research work in swarm robotics is mainly based on two way communication. Using the same onboard transceiver module, certain limited modifications to this robot would be needed for indoor navigation using wireless sensor networks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: It is often important to obtain the real-time location of a small-sized ground robotic vehicle when it performs autonomous tasks either indoors or outdoors. We propose and implement LOBOT, a low-cost, self-contained localization system for small-sized ground robotic vehicles. LOBOT provides accurate real-time, 3D positions in both indoor and outdoor environments. Unlike other localization schemes, LOBOT does not require external reference facilities, expensive hardware, careful tuning or strict calibration, and is capable of operating under various indoor and outdoor environments. LOBOT identifies the local relative movement through a set of integrated inexpensive sensors and well corrects the localization drift by infrequent GPS-augmentation. Our empirical experiments in various temporal and spatial scales show that LOBOT keeps the positioning error well under an accepted threshold.</td>
