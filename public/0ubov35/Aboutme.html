				    <h2>About me</h2>
					<p>â€œMy name is Salma Mohammed , and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience.  People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent communication skills.                                                                                                                I have had a variety of customer service opportunities, through which I was able to have fewer returned products and increased repeat customers, when compared with co-workers. I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player.
 I have worked in lead qualification,  and telemarketing in the technology industry. My experience includes successfully calling people in director-level positions of technology departments and developing viable leads.
