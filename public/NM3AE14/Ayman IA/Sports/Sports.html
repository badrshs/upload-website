    <h1>Sports</h1>
<p>Sports is my comfort zone, i spent everything i got, money, time all i have on sports as it is my life
It started when i was a child i learned how to play football and reached to the club team and i left them, and joined another Football team, little brief about that game, Swimming means how to Swim for along distants without getting injured or being tired it means how to regulate your breath , how to be in shape , how all your muscules work  .<br>
I heard a lot about The Greatness of Vollyball and i liked it so i decided to join my club team to train with them , and within 6 months i was able to play as a defender position and we achieved a lot of medals and titles ...
<br> 
And I also played:<br> 
1.  Basketball<br>
2.	Ping pong<br>
3.	Running<br>
4.	Swimming<br>
5.	Hocky<br>
Finally I decided to come back to my first Sport Football..
I Noticed that my weight got bigger in the stop period, so i had to train hard hard and after i lost this wheight it was great to join the game and the team again
I thank god for everything Iâ€™ve done in this life and for many blessings I have.
