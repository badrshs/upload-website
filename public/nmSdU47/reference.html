	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient intelligence opens up a world of unprecedented experiences. The interaction of people with electronic devices will change as context awareness, natural interfaces, and ubiquitous availability of information come to fruition. Ambient intelligence is going to impose major challenges on multimedia research. Distributed multimedia applications and their processing on embedded static and mobile platforms will play a major role in the development of ambient-intelligent environments. The requirements that ambient-intelligent multimedia applications impose on the mechanisms users apply to interact with media call for paradigms substantially different from contemporary interaction concepts. The complexity of media will continually increase in terms of volume and functionality, thus introducing a need for simplicity and ease of use. Therefore, the massively distributed, integrated use of media will require replacing well-known interaction vehicles, such as remote control and menu-driven search and control, with novel more intuitive, and natural concepts. This article reviews the concept of ambient intelligence and elaborates on its relation with multimedia. (The "Advances in media processing" sidebar gives insight into the developments that have set the stage for this new step forward.) The emphasis is on qualitative aspects, highlighting those elements that play a role in realizing ambient intelligence. Multimedia processing techniques and applications are key to realizing ambient intelligence, and they introduce major challenges to the design and implementation of both media-processing platforms and multimedia applications. Technology will not be the limiting factor in realizing ambient intelligence. The ingredients to let the computers disappear are already available, but the true success of the paradigm will depend on the ability to develop concepts that allow natural interaction with digital environments. We must build these digital environments with the invisible technology of the forthcoming century. The role of intelligent algorithms in this respect is apparent because it is the key enabling factor for realizing natural interaction.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ten years of AmI research have led to many new insights and understandings about the way highly interactive environments should be designed to meet the requirement of being truly unobtrusive and supportive from an end-user perspective. Probably the most revealing finding is the fact that, in addition to cognitive intelligence and computing, also elements from social intelligence and design play a dominant role in the realization of the vision. In this paper we discuss these novel insights and their resulting impact on the AmI research landscape. We introduce a number of new AmI research perspectives that are related to social intelligence and in addition we argue that new ways of working are required applying the concept of Experience Research resulting in a true user-centered approach to Ambient Intelligence.</td>

Early scenario's in Ambient Intelligence envisioned a world in which individuals could maximally exploit personalized, context aware, wireless devices thus enabling them to become maximally productive, while living at an unprecedented pace. Environments would become smart and proactive, enriching and enhancing the experience of participants thus supporting maximum leisure possibly even at the risk of alienation. New insights have revealed that these brave new world scenarios are no longer desirable and that people are more in for a balanced approach in which technology should serve people instead of driving them to the max. This novel approach is called Synergetic Prosperity, referring to meaningful digital solutions that balance mind and body, and community and earth thus contributing to a prosperous and sustainable development of mankind.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: When humans talk with humans, they are able to use implicit situational information, or context, to increase the conversational bandwidth. Unfortunately, this ability to convey ideas does not transfer well to humans interacting with computers. In traditional interactive computing, users have an impoverished mechanism for providing input to computers. By improving the computer’s access to context, we increase the richness of communication in human-computer interaction and make it possible to produce more useful computational services. The use of context is increasingly important in the fields of handheld and ubiquitous computing, where the user?s context is changing rapidly. In this panel, we want to discuss some of the research challenges in understanding context and in developing context-aware applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths.</td>

This framework will enable the robot to learn from past events and to adapt its behavior to the specific needs of the person that it interacts with. For this purpose, models will be created for both verbal and non-verbal communication. The user profile (e.g., personality, cognitive disability level, emotional internal states, preferences) will provide the input based on which the robot will adapt its behavior.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Modern public shared spaces offer a wide range of business and social functionalities. While they need to be efficiently operated, offering a secure environment is a prime objective. Manifold sensors and actuators, such as public lamps, surveillance systems or emergency phones, have been utilized in order to achieve this goal. Lights, cameras and a variate number of other sensors have been dealt with as discrete components. The problem may be looked at generically in solving the spatiotemporal requirements of monitoring the complete space, but plenty of factors should be carefully considered for feasible solution. The paper looks into utilizing the existing infrastructure within shared spaces, such as public lampposts for establishing a smart monitoring and management sensor-actuator networks or what we call public space Ambient Intelligence (PSAmI). We do this by presenting an appropriate system organization for such systems that is based on a real public space, Albert Park, NZ. Furthermore, we discuss the potential benefits of the integration of heterogeneous sensors and actuators. Afterwards, we explore the possible configurations for the lamp posts with a special focus on the camera component. Also, we identify the research challenges for realization of a PSAmI system.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: One major design goal in human-robot interaction is that the robots behave in an intelligent manner, preferably in a similar way as humans. This constraint must also be taken into consideration when the navigation system for the platform is developed. However, research in human-robot interaction is often restricted to other components of the system including gestures, manipulation, and speech. On the other hand, research for mobile robot navigation focuses primarily on the task of reaching a certain goal point in an environment. We believe that these two problems can not be treated separately for a personal robot that coexists with humans in the same surrounding. Persons move constantly while they are interacting with each other. Hence, also a robot should do that, which poses constraints on the navigation system. This type of navigation is the focus of this paper. Methods have been developed for a robot to join a group of people engaged in a conversation. Preliminary results show that the platform's moving patterns are very similar to the ones of the persons. Moreover, this dynamic interaction has been judged naturally by the test subjects, which greatly increases the perceived intelligence of the robot.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robots come into physical contact with humans in both experimental and operational settings. Many potential factors motivate the detection of human contact, ranging from safe robot operation around humans, to robot behaviors that depend on human guidance. This article presents a review of current research within the field of Tactile Human–Robot Interactions (Tactile HRI), where physical contact from a human is detected by a robot during the execution or development of robot behaviors. Approaches are presented from two viewpoints: the types of physical interactions that occur between the human and robot, and the types of sensors used to detect these interactions. We contribute a structure for the categorization of Tactile HRI research within each viewpoint. Tactile sensing techniques are grouped into three categories, according to what covers the sensors: (i) a hard shell, (ii) a flexible substrate or (iii) no covering. Three categories of physical HRI likewise are identified, consisting of contact that (i) interferes with robot behavior execution, (ii) contributes to behavior execution and (iii) contributes to behavior development. We populate each category with the current literature, and furthermore identify the state-of-the-art within categories and promising areas for future research. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There are many arguments for and against the use of autonomous-agents in intelligent environments. Some researchers maintain that it is of utmost importance to give complete control to users, and hence greatly restrict autonomy of agents, whereas, others believe that is it preferable to increase user convenience by allowing agents to operate autonomously on the user's behalf. While both of these approaches have their distinct merits, they are not suitable for all users. As people's opinions and concerns regarding agent autonomy are highly individual, depending on a wide range of factors and often changing over time, a much more dynamic approach to agent autonomy is needed. This work explores how it is possible to equip intelligent environments with an adjustable autonomy mechanism, which allows an individual user to increase or decrease agent autonomy in order to find their own comfortable sweet-spot between maintaining/relinquishing control and gaining/losing convenience. This paper presents the Adjustable Autonomy Intelligent Environment (AAIE) model, discusses how adjustable autonomy can be achieved in intelligent environments, and discusses the major findings from a recent online survey and user study, which highlight the major factors and concerns of users that determine their personal preferences towards different levels of autonomy.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Context-aware computing promises a smooth interaction between humans and technology but few studies have been conducted with regards to how autonomously an application should perform. After defining three levels of interactivity between a mobile computing device and its user: personalization, passive context-awareness and active context-awareness, we test which approach will limit users’ perceived sense of control. We also investigate users’ preferences for the three approaches. We conducted an experimental case study, using mobile phone applications to exemplify the three levels of interactivity. Our study shows that users feel less in control when using either passive or active context-aware applications than when personalizing their own applications. Despite this we also find that context-aware applications are preferred over the personalization oriented ones. We conclude that people are willing to give up partial control if the reward in usefulness is great enough.</td>

In contrast to other telepresence approaches, ambient telepresence is focused on mediating background activity to promote a peripheral sense of presence. A remote person's handling of everyday objects is mapped to an ambient presentation in the local work environment, based on ubiquitous computing and context-awareness technologies, allowing people at different locations to experience the ambient presence of others.

Initial evidence show that Giraff has become part of the daily routine of the user being judged as a valuable tool for communication and close connection with the remote user. In general, the attitude of the user towards the aid remains stable being constantly positive over time.

This year he was invited to do an up-to-date assessment of VR, with funding to visit major centers in North America and Europe. Every one of the component technologies has made big strides.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Due to the demographic change in the population the costs for healthcare and nursery will drastically increase in the coming years. Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technologies will never replace personal care, but can help to decrease costs by relieving care personnel and allowing elderly to stay independently at their own home for a longer time. Improvements in sensing technology lead to well-engineered and context-aware devices, that ease ones daily living activities, but there is still a gap according to data fusion. Current AmI applications face issues, such as: (i) proper situation classification, (ii) reduction of interpretation faults, (iii) action triggering, and (iv) projecting the future situation evaluation. There exists a huge amount of prototypes and systems, motivated by different requirements (use cases for processing environmental data, vital data, health data), which still have open issues when a global view on the data is needed for gaining situation awareness (SAW). This paper gives an overview of existing projects and seminal developments within the scope of AmI. After a survey on various AmI projects a common reference architecture was figured out and evaluation criteria focusing on SAW were defined. The criteria were used to classify selected projects and identify obstacles that avoid gaining SAW. In the end open issues and potential improvements are discussed and a perspective for further developments is given.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This article describes the software architecture of an autonomous, interactive tour-guide robot. It presents a modular and distributed software architecture, which integrates localization, mapping, collision avoidance, planning, and various modules concerned with user interaction and Web-based telepresence. At its heart, the software approach relies on probabilistic computation, on-line learning, and any-time algorithms. It enables robots to operate safely, reliably, and at high speeds in highly dynamic environments, and does not require any modifications of the environment to aid the robot's operation. Special emphasis is placed on the design of interactive capabilities that appeal to people's intuition. The interface provides new means for human-robot interaction with crowds of people in public places, and it also provides people all around the world with the ability to establish a “virtual telepresence” using the Web. To illustrate our approach, results are reported obtained in mid-1997, when our robot “RHINO” was deployed for a period of six days in a densely populated museum. The empirical results demonstrate reliable operation in public environments. The robot successfully raised the museum's attendance by more than 50%. In addition, thousands of people all over the world controlled the robot through the Web. We conjecture that these innovations transcend to a much larger range of application domains for service robots.</td>

It is based on the notion that media spaces can be thought of as the video counterpart of ubiquitous computing. The combination of the two is what we call Ubiquitous Media. We go on to discuss the synergies that result from approaching these two technologies from a unified perspective. The second thread is of a practice and experience nature. We discuss Ubiquitous Media from the perspective of having actually "lived the life." By basing our arguments on experience gained as part of the Ontario Telepresence Project, we attempt to anchor our views on practical experience rather than abstract speculation.</td>

Most of the western world will see a very large increase in the number of older people within the next 50 years with limited resources to care for them. AAL is seen as a promising alternative to the current care models and consequently has attracted lots of attention. Recently, a number of researchers have developed solutions based on video cameras and computer vision systems with promising results. However, for the domain to reach maturity, several challenges need to be faced, including the development of systems that are robust in the real-world and are accepted by users, carers and society. In this literature review paper we present a comprehensive survey of the scope of the domain, the existing technical solutions and the challenges to be faced.</td>

As they enter our everyday environments, it becomes critical to ensure their usability through natural Human-Drone Interaction (HDI). Previous work in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) shows that adding an emotional component is part of the key to success in robots' acceptability. We believe the adoption of personal drones would also benefit from adding an emotional component. This work defines a range of personality traits and emotional attributes that can be encoded in drones through their flight paths. We present a user study (N=20) and show how well three defined emotional states can be recognized. We draw conclusions on interaction techniques with drones and feedback strategies that use the drone's flight path and speed.</td>

Its main application areas, like Video Surveillance and Ambient-Assisted Living (AAL), have been in great demand in recent years. This paper provides a review on HBA for AAL and ageing in place purposes focusing specially on vision techniques. First, a clearly defined taxonomy is presented in order to classify the reviewed works, which are consequently presented following a bottom-up abstraction and complexity order. At the motion level, pose and gaze estimation as well as basic human movement recognition are covered. Next, the mainly used action and activity recognition approaches are presented with examples of recent research works. Increasing the degree of semantics and the time interval involved in the HBA, finally the behaviour level is reached. Furthermore, useful tools and datasets are analysed in order to provide help for initiating projects.</td>

Visually Impaired (VI) people require continuous assistance during their movement. Researchers and scientists have put many solutions to assist those people in the activities of their daily living (ADL). The current research delivers a novel indoor navigation system for visually impaired people. The proposed solution is designed for indoor use only (house, office, companies, etc.). It provides the visually impaired person the ability to navigate without any other hardware assistance. The proposed system architecture uses a network of IP cameras installed at the ceiling of each room. A remote processing system analyzes-by computer vision algorithms-photos taken from the environment in order to inform the subject about his location and reacts accordingly to deliver the adequate assistance. A guidance algorithm helps him reach his destination using a simple interactive mobile application installed on his smart phone. The proof of concept prototype was designed with one camera on top of a wooden floor model to simulate the system. Results showed good reliability in indoor navigation and obstacles avoidance.</td>

Instead of hospitalization or institutionalization, the elderly and disabled can be assisted in their own environment 24 h a day with numerous ‘smart’ devices. The concept of the smart home is a promising and cost-effective way of improving home care for the elderly and the disabled in a non-obtrusive way, allowing greater independence, maintaining good health and preventing social isolation. Smart homes are equipped with sensors, actuators, and/or biomedical monitors. The devices operate in a network connected to a remote centre for data collection and processing. The remote centre diagnoses the ongoing situation and initiates assistance procedures as required. The technology can be extended to wearable and in vivo implantable devices to monitor people 24 h a day both inside and outside the house. This review describes a selection of projects in developed countries on smart homes examining the various technologies available. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as the impact on modern society, are discussed. Finally, future perspectives on smart homes as part of a home-based health care network are presented.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mobility impairment is one of the biggest challenges faced by elderly people in today's society. The inability to move about freely poses severe restrictions on their independence and general quality of life. This work is dedicated to developing intelligent robotic platforms that assist users to move without requiring a human attendant. This work was done in the context of an EU project involved in developing an intelligent robot for elderly user assistance. The robot is equipped with a Kinect sensor, and the vision component of the project has the responsibility of locating the user, estimating the user's pose, and recognizing gestures by the user. All these goals can take advantage of a method that accurately segments human-limbs in the colour (RGB) and depth (D) images captured by the Kinect sensor. We exploit recent advances in deep-learning to develop a system that performs accurate semantic segmentation of human limbs using colour and depth images. Our novel technical contributions are the following: 1) we describe a scheme for manual annotation of videos, that eliminates the need to annotate segmentation masks in every single frame, 2) we extend a state of the art deep learning system for semantic segmentation, to exploit diverse RGB and depth data, in a single framework for training and testing, 3) we evaluate different variants of our system and demonstrate promising performance, as well the contribution of diverse data, on our in-house Human-Limb dataset. Our method is very efficient, running at 8 frames per second on a GPU.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the late 1990s, the question of control was raised in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) community within the process of designing computer interfaces. Following in their footsteps, the question of how much people want to be in control of their robots and how it affects the way we should design robotic interfaces is explored. To investigate the subject, we conducted a study which involved two fully autonomously operating mobile robots, namely a multi-purpose companion robot and a single-purpose domestic robot. The purpose of the study was to evaluate participants' sense of control (perceived control -who they felt was in charge of the robots- and desired control -how they wanted the action to be executed-) for a common domestic task: cleaning. Unexpectedly, the results show the higher the participants' desired control was, the more autonomous they wanted the companion robot to be (meaning the robot executed the needed task without an explicit permission from the participants).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the future, it will become more common for humans to team up with robotic systems to perform tasks that humans cannot realistically accomplish alone. Even for autonomous and semiautonomous systems, teleoperation will be an important default mode. However, teleoperation can be a challenging task because the operator is remotely located. As a result, the operator's situation awareness of the remote environment can be compromised and the mission effectiveness can suffer. This paper presents a detailed examination of more than 150 papers covering human performance issues and suggested mitigation solutions. The paper summarizes the performance decrements caused by video images bandwidth, time lags, frame rates, lack of proprioception, frame of reference, two-dimensional views, attention switches, and motion effects. Suggested solutions and their limitations include stereoscopic displays, synthetic overlay, multimodal interfaces, and various predicative and decision support systems.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient intelligence is an emerging discipline that brings intelligence to our everyday environments and makes those environments sensitive to us. Ambient intelligence (AmI) research builds upon advances in sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial intelligence. Because these contributing fields have experienced tremendous growth in the last few years, AmI research has strengthened and expanded. Because AmI research is maturing, the resulting technologies promise to revolutionarize daily human life by making people’s surroundings flexible and adaptive. In this paper, we provide a survey of the technologies that comprise ambient intelligence and of the applications that are dramatically affected by it. In particular, we specifically focus on the research that makes AmI technologies “intelligent”. We also highlight challenges and opportunities that AmI researchers will face in the coming years.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The increasing complexity of the new breed of distributed intelligent systems, such as the Internet of Things, which require a diversity of languages and protocols, can only be tamed with design and programming best practices. Interest is also growing for including the human factor, as advocated by the ambient intelligence (AmI) research field, whose focus is on transparently and intelligently supporting people. These new design methodologies are increasingly needed in the toolbox of new electronic and computer engineers, and teaching strategies should be devised that allow students to acquire a systems-level view instead of getting lost in technology-oriented approaches. This paper describes a study carried out over two academic years, in a course in AmI at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In the course, a project-based learning approach was adopted, in which students design and prototype an AmI system, and their progress is closely monitored throughout the semester. This paper presents the learning goals and teaching strategies, analyzes the learning outcomes from the qualitative and quantitative points of view, and highlights the lessons learned in the process.</td>

Indeed, support and care provision is very personal, i.e., assessments are individual and lead to specific care packages, involving social services, health workers, care agencies.

Therefore, we are in an urgent need for new, technological and formal approaches to problem solving, as the increase of population with special care requirements. Following this line of thought, it is one’s goal to present the VirtualECare framework, an intelligent multi-agent system able to monitor, interact and serve its customers, which are in need of care services, based in open standards, expecting not only to fulfil the objectives referred to above, but also to overcome the problems induced by the use of new technologies and formalisms.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to create innovative technical solutions and services to support independent living among older adults, improve their quality of life and reduce the costs associated with health and social care. AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To get the maximum benefit from ambient intelligence (AmI), we need to anticipate and react to possible drawbacks and threats emerging from the new technologies in order to devise appropriate safeguards. The SWAMI project took a precautionary approach in its exploration of the privacy risks in AmI and sought ways to reduce them. It constructed four ``dark scenarios'' showing possible negative implications of AmI, notably for privacy protection. Legal analysis of the depicted futures showed the shortcomings of the current legal framework in being able to provide adequate privacy protection in the AmI environment. In this paper, the authors, building upon their involvement in SWAMI research as well as the further advancement of EU privacy analysis, identify various outstanding issues regarding the legal framework that still need to be resolved in order to deal with AmI in an equitable and efficacious way. This article points out some of the lacunae in the legal framework and postulates several privacy-specific safeguards aimed at overcoming them.</td>

We also present the Context Toolkit, an architecture that supports the building of these context-aware applications. We discuss the features and abstractions in the toolkit that make the task of building applications easier. Finally, we introduce a new abstraction, a situation which we believe will provide additional support to application designers.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A smart home is a residence equipped with technology that observes the residents and provides proactive services. Most recently, it has been introduced as a potential solution to support independent living of people with disabilities and older adults, as well as to relieve the workload from family caregivers and health providers. One of the key supporting features of a smart home is its ability to monitor the activities of daily living and safety of residents, and in detecting changes in their daily routines. With the availability of inexpensive low-power sensors, radios, and embedded processors, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of networked sensors which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. This article reviews sensor technology used in smart homes with a focus on direct environment sensing and infrastructure mediated sensing. The article also points out the strengths and limitations of different sensor technologies, as well as discusses challenges and opportunities from clinical, technical, and ethical perspectives. It is recommended that sensor technologies for smart homes address actual needs of all stake holders including end users, their family members and caregivers, and their doctors and therapists. More evidence on the appropriateness, usefulness, and cost benefits analysis of sensor technologies for smart homes is necessary before these sensors should be widely deployed into real-world residential settings and successfully integrated into everyday life and health care services.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We are investigating a field of research that we call ubiquitous telepresence, which involves the design and implementation of low-cost robotic devices that can be programmed and operated from anywhere on the Internet. These devices, which we call ubots, can be used for academic purposes (e.g., a biologist could remote conduct a population survey), commercial purposes (e.g., a house could be shown remotely by a real-estate agent), and for recreation and education (e.g., someone could tour a museum remotely). We anticipate that such devices will become increasingly common due to recent changes in hardware and software technology. In particular, current hardware technology enables such devices to be constructed very cheaply (less than $500), and current software and network technology allows highly portable code to be written and downloaded across the Internet. In this paper, we present our prototype system architecture, and the ubot implementation we have constructed based on it. The hardware technology we use is the handy board, a 6811-based controller board with digital and analog inputs and outputs. Our software includes a network layer based on TCP/IP and software layers written in Java. Our software enables users across the Internet to program the behavior of the vehicle and to receive image feedback from a camera mounted on it.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today’s Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-topeople (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.</td>

Based on actual experiences in real-life scenarios, we point out the key issues that prohibit the remote interaction from being entirely seamless, and follow up with suggestions on how those problems can be resolved or alleviated. Furthermore, we evaluate our system with respect to overall usability and the different means for an end-user to experience the remote world.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the years ahead, as a result of the increasing demand for ubiquitous and continuous access to information and services, information technologies are expected to evolve toward a new computing paradigm known as ambient intelligence. Ambient intelligence will be characterized by invisible (i.e., embedded) computational power in everyday appliances and other common physical objects, including intelligent mobile and wearable devices. Ambient intelligence will have profound consequences on the type, content, and functionality of emerging products and services, as well as on the way people will interact with them, bringing about multiple new requirements for the development of information technologies. In addressing this challenge, the concept of universal access is critical. This paper discusses the anticipated opportunities and challenges that ambient intelligence will bring about for elderly people and people with disabilities, envisages new scenarios in the use of ambient-intelligence technologies by users with diverse needs and requirements, and identifies some of the critical issues that will have to be addressed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Our society will face a notable demographic shift in the near future. According to a United Nations report, the ratio of the elderly population (aged 60 years or older) to the overall population increased from 9.2% in 1990 to 11.7% in 2013 and is expected to reach 21.1% by 2050 [1]. According to the same report, 40% of older people live independently in their own homes. This ratio is about 75% in the developed countries. These facts will result in many societal challenges as well as changes in the health-care system, such as an increase in diseases and health-care costs, a shortage of caregivers, and a rise in the number of individuals unable to live independently [2]. Thus, it is imperative to develop ambient intelligence-based assisted living (AL) tools that help elderly people live independently in their homes. The recent developments in sensor technology and decreasing sensor costs have made the deployment of various sensors in various combinations viable, including static setups as well as wearable sensors. This article presents a survey that concentrates on the signal processing methods employed with different types of sensors. The types of sensors covered are pyro-electric infrared (PIR) and vibration sensors, accelerometers, cameras, depth sensors, and microphones.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We introduce the concept of Graspable User Interfaces which allow direct control of electronic or virtual objects through physical handles for control. These physical artifacts are essentially new input devices which can be tightly coupled or “attached ” to virtual objects for manipulation or for expressing action (e.g., to set parameters or for initiating processes). We present three steps in the development of these ideas. First, as a note on research methodology, we outline a series of exploratory studies that were conducted. Secondly, we describe a prototype system called &amp;quot;Bricks &amp;quot; and a sample application, GraspDraw, which was developed to investigate the Graspable UI concepts and to design new one- and twohanded interaction techniques. The physical artifacts, or bricks, operate on top of a large horizontal display surface known as the ActiveDesk. Finally, we conclude by presenting a design space for Bricks which lay the foundation for further exploring and developing graspable user interfaces.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper provides a general approach to the problem of designing proper “interfaces” between humans and technologies at home. These interfaces should be designed for “all users”, i.e. as friendly and simple to operate as possible, whatever the real technical background and/or motor ability of the user. The paper describes a philosophical approach and the consequent technical solution to these problems proposed in the framework of a European joint research project: the TIDE-MOVAID project (mobility and activity assistance systems for the disabled). The MOVAID approach is based on the assumption that all users are disabled when facing new technologies. MOVAID aims to provide solutions for interfacing all users, including the moderately and severely disabled, with their home environment. The general needs for simplicity and functionality of able-bodied and moderately disabled users are catered for by model friendly interfaces for standard appliances while the need of independence and autonomy of operation of the severely disabled users are catered for by a mobile manipulator robotic interface (the MOVAID unit). In the paper, the MOVAID approach and the prototypes of a novel friendly interface for a microwave oven and of the MOVAID mobile unit are presented in detail. Furthermore, the results of validation tests with moderately disabled users of the appliance interface are reported and discussed</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract The use of multiple robots working cooperatively in a redundant way offers new possibilities in the execution of complex tasks in dynamic workspaces. The aim of this work is to increase the range of applicability of teleoperated systems by means of the automatic cooperation of multiple slave robots which, controlled by a human operator, act as if they were a unique robot: a Multi-Robot Cooperation Platform for Task-Oriented Teleoperation, MRCP. From the human operator commands, this robotic platform, the MRCP, dynamically selects the most suitable slave robot and manages, when necessary, a task transfer from one robot to another in order to achieve a smooth execution of teleoperated tasks. The result of the proposed methodology is an improved teleoperated system in terms of reachable workspace (volume, manoeuvrability and accessibility) and dexterity, thus widening its range of applicability. This approach allows human operators to focus their attention on the ongoing task more than on the teleoperated robots. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The use of autonomous, mobile professional service robots in diverse workplaces is expected to grow substantially over the next decade. These robots often will work side by side with people, collaborating with employees on tasks. Some roboticists have argued that, in these cases, people will collaborate more naturally and easily with humanoid robots as compared with machine-like robots. It is also speculated that people will rely on and share responsibility more readily with robots that are in a position of authority. This study sought to clarify the effects of robot appearance and relative status on human-robot collaboration by investigating the extent to which people relied on and ceded responsibility to a robot coworker. In this study, a 3 × 3 experiment was conducted with human likeness (human, human-like robot, and machine-like robot) and status (subordinate, peer, and supervisor) as dimensions. As far as we know, this study is one of the first experiments examining how people respond to robotic coworkers. As such, this study attempts to design a robust and transferable sorting and assembly task that capitalizes on the types of tasks robots are expected to do and is embedded in a realistic scenario in which the participant and confederate are interdependent. The results show that participants retained more responsibility for the successful completion of the task when working with a machine-like as compared with a humanoid robot, especially when the machine-like robot was subordinate. These findings suggest that humanoid robots may be appropriate for settings in which people have to delegate responsibility to these robots or when the task is too demanding for people to do, and when complacency is not a major concern. Machine-like robots, however, may be more appropriate when robots are expected to be unreliable, are less well-equipped for the task than people are, or in other situations in which personal responsibility should be emphasized.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This study is about developing an open architecture platform for implementing mobile-phone-centric ambient intelligence. In the proposed sensor network architecture, a mobile phone acts as a central node hosting applications and connecting a local sensor network to back-end servers in the internet. The architecture includes a context awareness layer that abstracts sensor measurements into context atoms through rule-based reasoning and notifies changes in atoms to local and remote applications. The technologies used in the architecture include Simple Sensor Interface (SSI) protocol, nanoIP and low-power short-range radios. The architecture has been implemented and successfully demonstrated using several applications with a commercially available mobile phone with add-on electronics. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ontologies have been becoming popular knowledge representation methods very particularly for the areas of semantic web and smart environments. This paper focuses on design of "User Behaviour Ontologies" in Ambient Intelligence (Ami) environment using ontology creation tool. Sensors are installed in the environment so that users' behaviour will be sensed and stored by the devices in that environment. The stored behaviour data will be refined and formed as a temporal sequence. Then the ontology will be constructed through mapping relations between behaviour and related temporal sequence. This work demonstrated the different ways of ontological representations. The advantage of this approach is that it makes the cognitive support easier to the teachers.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: E-commerce has been one of the success stories of the last decade. Developments in wireless communications and mobile computing have heralded an era of mobile commerce (m-commerce). Though a number of successful applications and services have been deployed, these are almost invariably inherently static in nature. By augmenting m-commerce with intelligent and autonomous components, the significant benefits of convenience and added value may be realized for the average shopper as they wander their local shopping mall or high street. By a selective and judicious juxtaposition of Ambient Intelligent (AmI) concepts and e-commerce precepts, the foundations for truly ubiquitous commerce (u-commerce) may be constructed. In this paper, the synergy between AmI and e-commerce is explored and developed, resulting in the description of a prototypical application that demonstrates the viability of this approach.</td>

In this paper, we propose “transcendent telepresence” that aims to achieve better communication via telepresence that is impossible to achieve using F2F interactions. Transcendent telepresence enhances nonverbal information in telecommunication to enhance positive psychological effects and suppress negative effects by modifying the transmitted information. It complements the individual differences by adding functions that humans do not possess. Here, the concept of transcendent telepresence, examples, and researches of our group have been introduced. The overview of the research on “eye avatar” that can control the range of the gaze cone by switching convex eye and hollow eye has been specifically introduced. Our evaluation experiment on the eye avatar showed that the convex eye can send the correct gaze direction to audience and the hollow eye can send longer direct gaze to audience more widely.</td>

A general multivariable system architecture is utilized which includes all four-types of data transmission between master and slave: force and velocity in both directions. It is shown that a proper use of an four channels is of critical importance in achieving high performance telepresence in the sense of accurate transmission of task impedances to the operator. It is also shown that transparency and robust stability (passivity) are conflicting design goals in teleoperation systems. The analysis is illustrated by comparing transparency and stability in two common architectures, as well as a recent passivated approach and a new transparency-optimized architecture, using simplified one-degree-of-freedom examples</td>

The joint motions of the operator's head and arm in the real world captured by a Kinect camera can be transferred into the workspace mathematically via forward and inverse kinematics, realitically through data based UDP connection between the robot and Kinect sensor.

AmI is a vision of future information society, where people are surrounded by a digital environment that is sensitive to their needs, personalized to their requirements, anticipatory of their behavior, and responsive to their presence. It emphasizes on greater user friendliness, user empowerment, and more effective service support, with an aim to bring information and communication technology to everyone, every home, every business, and every school, thus improving the quality of human life. AmI unprecedentedly enhances learning experiences by endowing the users with the opportunities of learning in context, a breakthrough from the traditional education settings. In this survey paper, we examine some major characteristics of an AmI learning environment. To deliver a feasible and effective solution to ambient learning, we overview a few latest developed enabling technologies in context awareness and interactive learning. Associated practices are meanwhile reported. We also describe our experience in designing and implementing a smart class prototype, which allows teachers to simultaneously instruct both local and remote students in a context-aware and natural way.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, sophisticated technologies for personal monitoring are rapidly spreading. Mainly, these devices are medical sensors for domestic use, that allow for monitoring the most important physiological parameters. These smart devices enable to detect information closely related to the user’s health. Despite the effectiveness of these tools, such approaches do not allow for the detection of the personal wellness state, in a wider sense. From this point of view, more information can be detected by the analysis of user’s behavior. Especially in the case of elderly users, changes of behavior may be clues of situation of uneasiness or worsening of health condition. To support the monitoring of wellness conditions, tools and techniques for behavioral analysis have been developed at Information Engineering Department of University of Parma (ITALY). In this paper, a non-invasive and cost-effective technology is presented: the CARDEAdomus Ambient Assisted Living System. Eventually, results related to a experimentation, carried out by means of the System in a real context, are showed.</td>

The robotic system is able to provide physical support and guidance while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. To effectively solve different situations against obstacles, a training stage of learning human user-adaptive characteristics is adopted. Through wireless communication and localization technique, the user operation status, including the position of robot, can be monitored by the server. In this server, we also develop a call-to-come service for the robotic system. The experimental test-bed has a cart-based configuration with a nonholonomic differential drive mainly for forward direction. Experimentation and evaluation are presented to present the validity of the developed robotic system.</td>

This assistance can be done with the help of volunteers using technology and in particular pervasive and mobile computing. We propose in this paper Assist-Me, a smart system aimed at assisting elderly people in case of emergency. The goal is to enhance elderly people daily life independence and autonomy, in indoor and outdoor environments, by offering flexible and faster assistance in emergency situations via social intervention offered by volunteers. We believe that our solution can alleviate the unnecessary intervention of emergency center, provide a flexible volunteering intervention and better serve elderly people in needs. Assist-Me includes two smartphone applications: one for elderly people that require emergency assistance and the second for volunteers who receive the request. Assist-Me manages emergency situations by automatically selecting appropriate volunteers based on fuzzy-logic engine. The implementation of the engine is also presented in this paper.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a vision of a world in which people will be surrounded by networks of intelligent devices that are sensitive and adaptive to their needs. This concept implies a consumer-oriented industry driven by software from the top, and enabled (and constrained) by nano-scale physics at the atomic level. "More-Moore" will be needed to deliver the giga-ops computation and GHz communication capabilities required for stationary and wearable devices. But AmI also creates new challenges at the architectural and physical levels. To make AmI possible, AmI devices need two-orders-of-magnitude-lower power dissipation than today's microprocessors, at one-twentieth of the cost. These requirements conflict with the embedded programmability needed for personalization and adaptation to new services. We focus on emerging techniques for bridging this gap between software-centric systems and power-efficient platform architectures for AmI devices. A second challenge is to cope with the fact that nano-scale physical phenomena are in conflict with the traditional "nice and predictable" digital abstractions now used for complexity management. Techniques for coping with uncertainty and signal degradation, while achieving better-than-worst-case design, are discussed. Finally, one must realize that, to facilitate AmI, "more-than-Moore" technology is required, for example, for the design of autonomous wireless sensor networks. Correspondingly, attention is paid to novel combinations of technologies above and around CMOS, for the design of ultra-low-power, ultra-simple sensor motes for AmI.</td>

Research in the AAL community covers a wide range of topics, but one of the largest is human activity recognition and behavior understanding, with the objectives of detecting and recognizing actions, activity, and situations within an environment. AAL systems go beyond observing to interact with users. A frequently employed form of human-machine interaction is via prompts-for example, prompting the user to perform the next step in a sequence of actions. Another type of interaction is haptic responses, which have been used in systems for visually impaired people. Two important elements of an appropriate response are an understanding of the user's context and anticipatory capability. Context awareness underpins much of AAL research-human activities are generally context dependent. In the broader sense, context awareness uses sensor observations to abstract information about the current situation. Endowing a system with predictive capability lets it anticipate and thereby produce a timely and useful response.</td>

Behavior is defined as any pattern in a sequence of observations. In analyzing behavior in a smart home, we aim to detect gradual changes in behavior, and atypical (anomalous) behavior. The anomalous behavior may be the result of equipment failure or the result of significant variations in the behavior of the occupant. In the context of a smart home, both situations require human intervention although the response will differ. For the purpose of observing behavior, the smart home is equipped with embedded sensors that unobtrusively record various environmental parameters. Models of behavior are generated from the sensor data. These models are employed to detect trends and infer atypical behavior.</td>

This paper provides a short tutorial on how robots are currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR) and discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past eight years. A domain theory of the search activity is formulated. The domain theory consists of two parts: 1) a workflow model identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles in robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a general information flow model of how data from the robot is fused by various team members into information and knowledge. The information flow model also captures the types of situation awareness needed by each agent in the rescue robot system. The article presents a synopsis of the major HRI issues in reducing the number of humans it takes to control a robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging acceptance within the existing social structure.</td>

As a result of using standardized interfaces, any UPnP control point may be used to invoke actions on virtual, UPnP devices. Such devices are dynamically inserted to the environment and can be removed at run-time. Data delivered by sensors is interpreted by an environment monitoring component which routes higher-level atomic context information to virtual objects. As a result of invoked device actions and gathered context information, resulting state changes (e.g., switching light states) are visualized within the scene.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we develop possible realizations of pseudo-haptic feedback in teleoperation systems based on existing works for pseudo-haptic feedback in virtual reality and the intended applications. We derive four potential factors affecting the performance of haptic feedback (calculation operator, maximum displacement, offset force, and scaling factor), which are analyzed in three compliance identification experiments. First, we analyze the principle usability of pseudo-haptic feedback by comparing information transfer measures for teleoperation and direct interaction. Pseudo-haptic interaction yields well above-chance performance, while direct interaction performs almost perfectly. In order to optimize pseudo-haptic feedback, in the second study we perform a full-factorial experimental design with 36 subjects performing 6,480 trials with 36 different treatments. Information transfer ranges from 0.68 bit to 1.72 bit in a task with a theoretical maximum of 2.6 bit, with a predominant effect of the calculation operator and a minor effect of the maximum displacement. In a third study, short- and long-term learning effects are analyzed. Learning effects regarding the performance of pseudo-haptic feedback cannot be observed for single-day experiments. Tests over 10 days show a maximum increase in information transfer of 0.8 bit. The results show the feasibility of pseudo-haptic feedback for teleoperation and can be used as design basis for task-specific systems.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Navigation is an essential element of many remote robot operations including search and rescue, reconnaissance, and space exploration. Previous reports on using remote mobile robots suggest that navigation is difficult due to poor situation awareness. It has been recommended by experts in human-robot interaction that interfaces between humans and robots provide more spatial information and better situational context in order to improve an operator's situation awareness. This paper presents an ecological interface paradigm that combines video, map, and robot-pose information into a 3-D mixed-reality display. The ecological paradigm is validated in planar worlds by comparing it against the standard interface paradigm in a series of simulated and real-world user studies. Based on the experiment results, observations in the literature, and working hypotheses, we present a series of principles for presenting information to an operator of a remote robot.</td>

So far, scenarios have most times presented the perception that one person has upon the system, with few details on how the system should work in the background in order to deal with realistic requirements. In this paper, starting from scenarios presented in previous research, we identify features and requirements for AmI systems and propose two new scenarios, focusing on the way information is exchanged beyond the perspective of, and transparent to, the user of the system.We also agentify one of the scenarios, giving insight on how an AmI system may be built, using software agents, in order to fulfill the requirements.</td>

If this prediction is to come true, then next generation computing should be about anticipatory user interfaces that should be human-centered, built for humans based on human models. They should transcend the traditional keyboard and mouse to include natural, human-like interactive functions including understanding and emulating certain human behaviors such as affecti0ve and social signaling.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for deciding which system functions should be automated and to what extent. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design</td>

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a motion rehabilitation and evaluation system based on the Kinect gesture measuring technology combining VR technology as well as traditional method of stroke rehabilitation. Real-time rehabilitation motion feedback is achieved by using Kinect motion capturing, customized skeleton modeling, and virtual characters constructed in Unity3D. The jitter problem of virtual characters following motion using Kinect is solved. Fidelity and interactivity of virtual rehabilitation training is improved. Our experiment validated the feasibility of this system preliminarily.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Recently, human–robot cooperation (HRC) research activities have focused on the development of new methodologies for the generation of safe robot trajectories. However, the applicability of such methodologies in a real context is limited due to the inherent uncertainty of robot trajectory execution time (i.e. the robot can avoid the worker by modifying its velocity along the path). This paper proposes an approach to estimate a confidence interval on robot trajectory execution time for scenarios in which human–robot space sharing is required. First, human arm movements are studied for a given set of assembly collaborative tasks: worker occupancy volumes and occupancy volume probabilities are derived. Then, a finite number of alternative robot trajectories, crossing human occupancy volumes with different occupancy probabilities, are generated. It is therefore possible to estimate a probability for the robot to reduce its velocity, and a confidence interval on the robot execution time. The application on a real assembly case is discussed.</td>

Today, most of the technologies needed for the realisation of this vision are next-generation technologies that are not currently on the market, but are being researched by research institutes and corporate laboratories worldwide. In Europe, the IST Advisory Group (ISTAG) and the FP6 IST programme are strong promoters of the AmI vision. This article gives a short overview of AmI, focuses on its role in everyday life and identifies some of the major challenges and bottlenecks facing the concept. The paper argues that, although people are presented as at the core of the vision, AmI would benefit from a more substantial everyday life perspective that confronts users in their everyday lives with future visions and technologies. Some of the key issues raised by such an approach are identified and discussed.</td>

In contrast, forgetting and erroneous reasoning are typical cognitive patterns of humans. This discrepancy may fundamentally affect the way how robots and humans interact and collaborate together and is today still little explored. In this paper, we investigate the effect of differences between erroneous and perfect robots in a competitive scenario in which humans and robots solve reasoning tasks and memorize numbers. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: in the first group they interact with a perfect, flawless robot, while in the second, they interact with a human-like robot with occasional errors and imperfect memorizing abilities. Participants rate attitude, sympathy, and attributes of the robot in a questionnaire and we measure their task performance. The results show that the erroneous robot triggered more positive emotions but lead to a lower human performance than the perfect one. Effects of both conditions on the group of students with and without technical background are reported.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robotic middlewares increasingly allow the seamless integration of multiple heterogeneous robots into one distributed system. With the inclusion of ambient intelligence and pervasive computing, very simple devices such as WSN motes mounted sensors and actuators, rfid-tag attached everyday objects or smart objects should also be considered as part of this incorporation. Humans should also be a part of this NRS since one of the main objectives of this integrated robot systems is to serve humans. We argue that this inclusion of motes like tiny sensor-actuator devices, simple everyday objects and humans as part of the NRS brings many advantages when tasks are performed by cooperation. In order to achieve the goal, presenting all them in a robot middleware, my research (PhD) study has been started since Aug 2006. This paper represents our approach and achievement till today. In this study, models are inherited as well as proposed depending on the existing works. As the proof-of-concept, an illustrative experiment demonstrates how tiny devices and everyday objects become part of a NRS by adapting the proposed/inherited techniques, during this study, and cooperate to perform complex tasks.</td>

AmI fosters novel anthropomorphic human–machine models of interaction. In AmI, technologies are deployed to make computers disappear in the background, while the human user moves into the foreground in complete control of the augmented environment. AmI is a user-centric paradigm, it supports a variety of artificial intelligence methods and works pervasively, nonintrusively, and transparently to aid the user. AmI supports and promotes interdisciplinary research encompassing the technological, scientific and artistic fields creating a virtual support for embedded and distributed intelligence.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robots are already physically supporting humans within multiple processes, but as a step further, the robots will be able to identify and adapt to any individual strengths and become the flawless co-workers needed. One of the questions is whether in other fields of social robotics, e.g. in ergonomics, existing knowledge about human teams can be transferred into the design of hybrid teams and the shaping of human-computer interactions. These developments serve the appearance of Industry 4.0, which is directly correlated to the modernization of productions that are directly involved in defining the concept of hybrid human-robot-teams. This is a concept paper that describes the investigation whether the appearance of the robot and its accuracy while fulfilling the task influence the stress level of the human, his cooperation behavior and trust towards the robot, and as an overall result the performance of the cooperative work in a complete virtual environment. The participants will be given a task to accomplish with the aid of their virtual robot partner and rely on their features and abilities, they have to act as efficiently as possible, which gives room to investigate the teamwork over various team development stages, stress, trust, and performance. The study will take place in August 2016, where the results will be published shortly afterwards.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology, in which people are empowered through a digital environment that is aware of their presence and context, and is sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to their needs, habits, gestures and emotions. The most ambitious expression of AmI is Intelligent Mixed Reality (IMR), an evolution of traditional virtual reality environments. Using IMR, it is possible to integrate computer interfaces into the real environment, so that the user can interact with other individuals and with the environment itself in the most natural and intuitive way. How does the emergence of the AmI paradigm influence the future of health care? Using a scenario-based approach, this paper outlines the possible role of AmI in health care by focusing on both its technological and relational nature. In this sense, clinicians and health care providers that want to exploit AmI potential need a significant attention to technology, ergonomics, project management, human factors and organizational changes in the structure of the relevant health service.</td>

Students' teams work on designing and implementing a real-time controller based on an artificial neural network for a motion control of mechanical system with non-linear dynamics. On general the course is designed to provide the students deeper understanding and integration of the concepts that come from different disciplines that are usually handed within separate courses. The course was tested within summer school with 31 participants from seven countries and evaluated by survey. The survey's results indicate student satisfaction with the learning experience and gained knowledge. The summer school experience was used as a basis for two courses that are now included into regular master level education in `System design' program.</td>

We propose to combine these two visions into the new concept of an ecology of networked Physically Embedded Intelligent Systems (PEIS).

Nowadays, computers are not only the new interaction partners of humans, but also a privileged interaction medium for social exchange between humans. Consequently, enhancing machine abilities to interpret and reproduce social signals is a crucial requirement for improving computer-mediated communication and interaction. Furthermore, automated analysis of such signals creates a host of new applications and improvements to existing applications. The study of social signals benefits a wide range of domains, including human-computer interaction, interaction design, entertainment technology, ambient intelligence, health-care, and psychology.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Intelligence is increasingly emerging in our ambients. Evidences of this emergence are the existence of smart homes, smart vehicles, intelligent manufacturing systems and most importantly, the appearance of the concept of intelligent cities. Humans are presently surrounded by technology that is intended to increase their quality of life and simplify their daily activities. Multi-Agent Systems are an example of technology that can be used in these activities. The concept of ubiquitous computing is implicit in these technologies and can generate an invisible ambient of interactivity. This paper presents a survey and a comparative analysis of some of the research projects concerning Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The main objective of this work was to understand the current necessities, devices and the main results in the development of these projects. By analysing these projects using several evaluation criteria one of the main conclusions is that most projects do not explore the potential of human profiles in the context of ambient adaptation. Thus, this may be a very interesting research area for future work.</td>

Human activities are so complex and dynamic that it's often unclear what information is even relevant for modeling activities. Robust approaches to recognize user activities requires identifying the relevant information to be sensed and the appropriate sensing technologies. In our effort to develop an approach for automatically estimating hospital-staff activities, we trained a discrete hidden Markov model (HMM) to map contextual information to a user activity. We trained the model and evaluated it using data captured from almost 200 hours of detailed observation and documentation of hospital workers. In this article, we discuss our approach, the results, and how activity recognition could empower our vision of the hospital as a smart environment.</td>

This is where a simulator could help to arrive to an optimal set up without the need of expending money installing the required devices until we are sure we have achieved the desired configuration.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Interactive systems have been the dominant computing paradigm over recent years. This paradigm is characterized by the fact that human user and the system communicate and interact explicitly using different modalities. However to come closer to visions of Ambient Intelligence, Calm Computing, Disappearing Computing, and Ubiquitous Computing new forms of interaction are required. Observing humans interacting with each other and new possibilities given by emerging technologies indicate that a new interaction model is needed. In this chapter we present the concept of implicit human computer interaction (iHCI) that takes the users context into account when creating new user interfaces for ambient intelligence. Beyond the model examples are given, application areas are described and basic implementation issues are discussed. Our research leads to a more general discussion on disappearing and invisible user interfaces. In the invisibility dilemma we explain that in many application areas there may be an inherent conflict. The transparent user interface and the added value gained by introducing technology are often opposing goals, especially combined with users that are creative in appropriating their tools.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Human-robot interaction (HRI) for mobile robots is still in its infancy. Most user interactions with robots have been limited to tele-operation capabilities where the most common interface provided to the user has been the video feed from the robotic platform and some way of directing the path of the robot. For mobile robots with semiautonomous capabilities, the user is also provided with a means of setting way points. More importantly, most HRI capabilities have been developed by robotics experts for use by robotics experts. As robots increase in capabilities and are able to perform more tasks in an autonomous manner we need to think about the interactions that humans will have with robots and what software architecture and user interface designs can accommodate the human in-the-loop. We also need to design systems that can be used by domain experts but not robotics experts. This paper outlines a theory of human-robot interaction and proposes the interactions and information needed by both humans and robots for the different levels of interaction, including an evaluation methodology based on situational awareness.</td>

Nevertheless, the testing phase of intelligent software systems managing smart homes, in real environments, requires an enormous effort in terms of time, work and money. With this paper, we discuss the possibility to use 3D virtual environments during the developing and preliminary tests of such systems, as it happens in robotics with 3D simulators. Even if this approach cannot totally replace the need of real user trials, it can speed up the implementation of prototypes, decoupling software from hardware. We also present a brief description of a proof-of-concept, showing some of the benefits described.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Global competition is driving manufacturing companies to change the way they do business. New kinds of shop floor control systems need to be implemented for these companies to respond quickly to changing shop floor environments and customer demands. This paper presents a new concept called iShopFloor-an intelligent shop floor based on the Internet, web, and agent technologies. It focuses on the implementation of distributed intelligence in the manufacturing shop floor. The proposed approach provides the framework for components of a complex control system to work together as a whole rather than as a disjoint set. It encompasses both information architecture and integration methodologies. The paper introduces the basic concept of iShopFloor, a generic system architecture, and system components. It also describes the implementation of eXtensible Markup Language message services in iShopFloor and the application of intelligent agents to distributed manufacturing scheduling. A prototype environment is presented, and some implementation issues are discussed.</td>

Increasingly, humans are asked to interact with automation in complex and typically large-scale systems, including aircraft and air traffic control, nuclear power, manufacturing plants, military systems, homes, and hospitals. This is not an easy or error-free task for either the system designer or the human operator/automation supervisor, especially as computer technology becomes ever more sophisticated. This review outlines recent research and challenges in the area, including taxonomies and qualitative models of human-automation interaction; descriptions of automation-related accidents and studies of adaptive automation; and social, political, and ethical issues.</td>

A speech-capable computer-animated virtual assistant lets the teacher control the presentation of lecture materials and informs the teacher of classroom events. In addition, a context-aware Smart Cameraman module automatically switches between several cameras so the live video for remote students always follows the class focus. The system's underlying software infrastructure, the Smart Platform, has a multi-agent based architecture with a loosely coupled publish-subscribe coordination model and a well-defined wire protocol. The Smart Platform's development interface is fairly simple, so developers can easily understand and use the system.</td>

We take an object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc. Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes. The system runs at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching. 1.</td>

We claim that a human aware motion planner (HAMP) must not only provide safe robot paths, but also synthesize good, socially acceptable and legible paths. This paper focuses on a motion planner that takes explicitly into account its human partners by reasoning about their accessibility, their vision field and their preferences in terms of relative human-robot placement and motions in realistic environments. This planner is part of a human-aware motion and manipulation planning and control system that we aim to develop in order to achieve motion and manipulation tasks in the presence or in synergy with humans.</td>

To achieve this capability for the robot and for its effective remote control, a shared-control method has been developed. The controller determines the control gains for both the human and the autonomous commands by computing the user's confidence factor. For ease of use, a smartphone/tablet is used to control the robot. Using this approach, the robot allows the user to manipulate its motion from a remote site and compensates for a lack of local human knowledge. Practical experiments validate the proposed design and demonstrate the potential of the proposed shared-control method for home-service tasks.</td>

The defintion of virtual reality is based on concepts of “presence” and “telepresence,” which refer to the sense of being in an environment, generated by natural or mediated means, respectively. Two technological dimensions that contribute to telepresence, vividness and interactivity, are discussed. A variety of media are classified according to these dimensions.

The paper specifically focuses upon AmI application in manufacturing industry. The new definition of AmI systems in industry is proposed intending to indicate a clear correlation between AmI systems and ‘classical intelligent control’. The so-called Reference Architecture for AmI systems, serving as a tool for the development of the AmI based control systems, is initially proposed as well. The typical control schemes for AmI based control system (in industry) are defined and analysed intending to identify the key aspects that differentiate the AmI control systems from classical schemes. The analysis has indicated that an increased observability of the whole system and specifically of human operator and his/her environment (ambience) is the key element leading to a more effective control and higher intelligence of AmI systems. The possible applications of the proposed Reference Architecture for different processes and plants in industry are considered.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The population of elderly people keeps increasing rapidly, which becomes a predominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a new approach which promises to address the needs from elderly people. Ambient intelligence technologies are widely developed in this domain aiming to construct safe environments around assisted peoples and help them maintain independent living. However, there are still many fundamental issues in AAL that remain open. Most of the current efforts still do not fully express the power of human being, and the importance of social connections and social activities is less noticed. Our conjecture is that such features are fundamental prerequisites towards truly effective AAL services. This paper reviews the current status of researches on AAL, discusses the promises and possible advantages of AAL, and also indicates the challenges we must meet in order to develop practical and efficient AAL systems for elderly people. In this paper, we also propose an approach to construct effective home-care system for the elderly people.</td>

Despite many industrial innovations and academic progresses have been made, we find a lack of fully context-aware smart cars. This study presents a general architecture of smart cars from the viewpoint of context-awareness. A hierarchical context model is proposed for description of the complex driving environment. A smart car prototype including software platform and hardware infrastructures is built to provide the running environment for the context model and applications. Two performance metrics were evaluated: accuracy of the context situation recognition and efficiency of the smart car. The whole response time of context situation recognition is nearly 1.4 s for one person, which is acceptable for non-time critical applications in a smart car.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The significance that ambient intelligence (AmI) has acquired in recent years requires the development of innovative solutions. In this sense, the development of AmI-based systems requires the creation of increasingly complex and flexible applications. One of the most important aspects in AmI is the use of context-aware technologies in order to perceive stimuli from both the users and the environment. Thus, the information obtained must be managed by intelligent and self-adaptable technologies in order to provide an adequate interaction between the users and their environment. Agents and multiagent systems are one of these technologies. The agents have characteristics such as autonomy, reasoning, reactivity, social abilities and pro-activity which make them appropriate for developing dynamic and distributed systems based on AmI, as they possess the capability of adapting themselves to the users and environmental characteristics. This paper presents several case studies where agents and context-aware technologies have been implemented to build AmI-based systems. These case studies expand the possibilities of AmI and get closer to its vision.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract This chapter describes research that aims to develop theories, methods, and tools to understand the mechanisms of neuromotor adaptation in human-robot physical interaction. Human power-assisting systems, eg, powered lifting devices that aid human operators in manipulating heavy or bulky loads, require physical contact between the operator and machine, hence creating a coupled dynamic system. This coupling has been shown to be prone to inherent instabilities and performance degradation due to a change in human arm stiffness; when instability is encountered, a human operator often attempts to control the oscillation by stiffening their arm, which leads to a stiffer system with more instability. The goal of the research is to develop control algorithms for robot coworkers that adaptively adjust the contact impedance between the operator and robotic manipulator in order to achieve higher performance and stability. To this end, this chapter will discuss how to: (1) understand the association between neuromuscular adaptations and system performance limits, (2) develop probabilistic methods to classify and predict the transition of the operator's physical and/or cognitive states from physiological measurements, and (3) integrate this knowledge into a structure of shared human-robot control. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Proactive, context-aware computing isn't new. In 2000, David Tennenhouse called for a change in the boundary between the physical and virtual worlds. He identified proactive computing as an alternative to interactive computing and defined how future systems should become more involved with the real world. He also considered context-aware control systems with online adaptation especially promising. Today, ambient-intelligence researchers show increasing interest in both proactive applications and context-aware applications. Using different context-recognition methods, researchers can easily gather application-specific information from the environment and enable context-triggered actions. According to Hee Eon Byun and Keith Cheverst, a context-aware home can serve its inhabitants more flexibly and adaptively than an ordinary home. They also claim that proactive systems can be built using machine-learning algorithms with context recognition. In addition to context recognition, adaptivity is essential in intelligent environments. In terms of computing systems, the environment can adjust itself using adaptation mechanisms to comply with user preferences; it can become unobtrusive and better support user activities. A home adapting to its inhabitants' living style is much more convenient than a user adapting to the home's behavior. In this article, we show how to develop a proactive, adaptive, fuzzy home-control system, present the algorithm we used for adaptation, and evaluate the test results we obtained.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the field of remotely controlled systems, stability is an issue researchers have to deal with. The reason is that usually, in such tasks, time delay occurs, which makes it challenging to design stable controllers. For this reason, more dedicated research has been started to determine the stability properties of time delay systems, particularly of bilateral teleoperation systems, and find stable control strategies. In this paper, authors show that the recent control solutions for time delay teleoperation systems open a new dimension for the interpretation of the basic concepts of controlling systems in general, and make the reevaluation of these concepts necessary. Traditional methods fail in many cases due to stability issues particularly when the time delay is varying or communication blackout occurs. The paper gives a brief overview of different techniques and discusses their applicability.</td>

The surveillance task is a complex one involving people, management procedures, and technology. This work describes an architecture that takes into account the distributed nature of the detection processes and the need to allow for different types of devices and actuators. This was part of a major European initiative on intelligent transport systems. Because of the dominant nature of closed circuit television in surveillance, This work describes in detail a computer-vision module used in the system and its particular ability to detect situations of interest in busy conditions. The system components have been implemented, integrated, and tested in real metropolitan railway environments and are considered to be the first step toward providing ambient intelligence in such complex scenarios. Results are presented that not only deal with detection performance, but also on the perception of people who used the system on its effectiveness and potential impact.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, applications are discussed that describe achievements along the road towards 'Ambient Intelligence'. Appliances and devices disappear into the environment of the individual; instead services come into focus. Key to this development are system solutions that lead to a significant improvement of the human-machine interface. Along this line, we present important technologies and key system components ranging from low-cost electronic technologies and systems, to ubiquitous sensor networks and electronics in smart textiles. In conclusion, this presentation relates the semiconductor technology roadmap to a future world in which electronics meets human needs in a pervasive, intuitive and beneficial way.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Teleoperation or Wizard-of-Oz control of social robots is commonly used in human-robot interaction (HRI) research. This is especially true for child-robot interactions, where technologies like speech recognition (which can help create autonomous interactions for adults) work less well. We propose to study young children's understanding teleoperation, how they conceptualize social robots in a learning context, and how this affects their interactions. Children will be told about the teleoperator's presence either before or after an interaction with a social robot. We will assess children's behavior, learning, and emotions before, during, and after the interaction. Our goal is to learn whether children's knowledge about the teleoperator matters (e.g., for their trust and for learning outcomes), and if so, how and when it matters most (e.g. at what age).</td>

We present AlarmNet, a novel system for assisted living and residential monitoring that uses a two-way flow of data and analysis between the front- and back-ends to enable context-aware protocols that are tailored to residents' individual patterns of living. AlarmNet integrates environmental, physiological, and activity sensors in a scalable heterogeneous architecture. The SenQ query protocol provides real-time access to data and lightweight in-network processing. Circadian activity rhythm analysis learns resident activity patterns and feeds them back into the network to aid context-aware power management and dynamic privacy policies.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the last few decades, scenarios have provided a way of analysing the implications of alternative futures, especially as they might be impacted by new technologies. This has been no less true of ambient intelligence (AmI), which may be embedded everywhere in the not so distant future. Most of the scenarios developed by AmI enthusiasts have been rather ‘sunny’, showing how the new technologies promise to make our lives more efficient, enjoyable, productive, enriching. A European project, called Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence (SWAMI), deliberately developed ‘dark scenarios’ to highlight the threats to privacy, identity, trust, security and inclusiveness posed by the new technologies. The SWAMI consortium also developed a methodological structure for deconstructing and analysing the dark scenarios. This paper takes that approach a step further by applying it to a cultural artefact, partly to test the validity, utility, applicability of the SWAMI methodology to a scenario not constructed by the consortium and partly to show how some cultural artefacts can be regarded as scenarios in their own right as well as warnings about future technologies. The cultural artefact chosen here was the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report, because it features so many AmI technologies and draws attention to the issues that have been the focus of the SWAMI project.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Purpose – To survey ambient intelligence research in Europe, the USA and Japan and, in particular, in the context of the issues of privacy, identity, security and trust and the safeguards proposed to protect them. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on research being conducted by the SWAMI consortium under the EC's Sixth Framework Programme. SWAMI stands for Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence. The consortium comprises five partners: the Fraunhofer Institute (Germany), the Technical Research Center of Finland (VTT Electronics), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium), the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) (Spain) and Trilateral Research &amp; Consulting (UK). The 18‐month SWAMI project began in February 2005. Findings – Most AmI projects do not take into account privacy, security and related issues. However, a reasonable number do (perhaps a quarter of those in Europe) to a greater or lesser extent and some have proposed safeguards. Research limitations/implications – This paper references only a limited set of the research projects being carried out in Europe, the USA and Japan. More detailed information can be found on the SWAMI web site (http://swami.jrc.es). Practical implications – A mix of different safeguards will be needed to adequately protect privacy, etc. in the new world of AmI. Originality/value – Until now, there has been no reasonably comprehensive survey of AmI research projects in Europe, the USA and Canada focused on privacy, security, identity and trust issues. None has considered the range of safeguards needed to protect privacy, etc.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, a novel control scheme is developed for a teleoperation system, combining the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) and wave variable technique to simultaneously compensate for the effects caused by communication delays and dynamics uncertainties. The teleoperation system is set up with a TouchX joystick as the master device and a simulated Baxter robot arm as the slave robot. The haptic feedback is provided to the human operator to sense the interaction force between the slave robot and the environment when manipulating the stylus of the joystick. To utilize the workspace of the telerobot as much as possible, a matching process is carried out between the master and the slave based on their kinematics models. The closed loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) method and RBF NN approximation technique are seamlessly integrated in the control design. To overcome the potential instability problem in the presence of delayed communication channels, wave variables and their corrections are effectively embedded into the control system, and Lyapunov-based analysis is performed to theoretically establish the closed-loop stability. Comparative experiments have been conducted for a trajectory tracking task, under the different conditions of various communication delays. Experimental results show that in terms of tracking performance and force reflection, the proposed control approach shows superior performance over the conventional methods.</td>

The main idea of ubiquitous telepresence is to allow users to project their physical presence anywhere on the internet. Specifically, users are given the ability to explore and interact with many remote physical environments (e.g., all sites on the internet) through remote sensing and manipulation devices. My vision for implementing ubiquitous telepresence is to build robotic or remote-controlled units at such low cost that they become as ubiquitous as television sets. Ubiquitous telepresence extends the concept of virtual reality by providing users with a physical embodiment of their presence in a physical location. Ubiquitous telepresence is related but separate from ubiquitous computing in the model of how telepresence is provided. In particular, ubiquitous telepresense focuses on providing telepresence by defining interfaces, software, and hardware for standard low-cost robotic devices (ub...</td>
