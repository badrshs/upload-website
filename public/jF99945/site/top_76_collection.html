	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ten years of AmI research have led to many new insights and understandings about the way highly interactive environments should be designed to meet the requirement of being truly unobtrusive and supportive from an end-user perspective. Probably the most revealing finding is the fact that, in addition to cognitive intelligence and computing, also elements from social intelligence and design play a dominant role in the realization of the vision. In this paper we discuss these novel insights and their resulting impact on the AmI research landscape. We introduce a number of new AmI research perspectives that are related to social intelligence and in addition we argue that new ways of working are required applying the concept of Experience Research resulting in a true user-centered approach to Ambient Intelligence.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient intelligence (AmI) is a novel concept for embedded computing that builds on the large-scale integration of electronic devices into peoples' surroundings and the ubiquitous availability of digital information to the users of such environments. The concept however is not only concerned with the integration of computing in the background but, as a direct result of the disappearing computer and the corresponding interaction technologies, it calls for novel means of control that support the natural and intelligent use of such smart environments, emphasizing predominantly social aspects. As the familiar box-like devices are replaced by hidden functions embedded in the surroundings, the classical meaning and implication of security and trust needs to be revisited in the context of ambient intelligence. In this chapter, we briefly revisit the foundations of the AmI vision by addressing the role of AmIware, which refers to the basic and enabling AmI technologies, and by presenting some basic definitions of ambient intelligence. Next we discuss the meaning and role of persuasion on the basis of models and theories for motivation originating from cognitive science. Notions such as compliance and ambient journaling are used to develop an understanding of the concept of ambient persuasion. We also address the ethics of ambient intelligence from the point of view of a number of critical factors such as trust and faith, crossing boundaries, and changing realities. The chapter concludes with a summary of findings and some final remarks.</td>

This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The development of ambient intelligence (AmI) applications that effectively adapt to the needs of the users and environments requires, among other things, the presence of planning mechanisms for goal-oriented behavior. Planning is intended as the ability of an AmI system to build a course of actions that, when carried out by the devices in the environment, achieve a given goal. The problem of planning in AmI has not yet been adequately explored in literature. We propose a planning system for AmI applications, based on the hierarchical task network (HTN) approach and called distributed hierarchical task network (D- HTN), able to find courses of actions to address given goals. The plans produced by D-HTN are flexibly tailored to exploit the capabilities of the devices currently available in the environment in the best way. We discuss both the architecture and the implementation of D-HTN. Moreover, we present some of the experimental results that validated the proposed planner in a realistic application scenario in which an AmI system monitors and answers the needs of a diabetic patient.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We are gradually making a transition to a new era where computers become truly intertwined with our daily lives. Up to not so long ago, we were able to know clearly where computers were and in which way they affected our lives. This has been gradually blurred and now computing devices of various types are all around us, embedded in different objects we interact with and in that way they influence our lives. There are indications that this trend is irreversible and that computing and society will now interact with each other in far richer ways than before, to the point that computing will become transparent to humans and still intrinsically involved in our daily living. This paper provides a brief overview of the evolution of these fields, describes some of the current developments, and points at some of the immediate challenges that researchers in these area face.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The in-house monitoring of elders using intelligent sensors is a very desirable service that has the potential of increasing autonomy and independence while minimizing the risks of living alone. Because of this promise, the efforts of building such systems have been spanning for decades, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. Driven by the recent technology advances in many of the required components, in this article, we present a scalable framework for detailed behavior inter- pretation. Our framework supports in-house monitoring of elders using an intelligent gateway and a set of cheap commercially available sensors, in addition to more advanced camera-based human localization sensors and a client for GPS-enabled mobile phones that provides monitoring when outdoors. In this article, we report our experiences and present our current progress in three main components: sensors, middleware, and behavior interpre- tation mechanisms spanning from simple programmable rule-based alerts to algorithms for extracting the temporal routines of individuals.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As a socially disruptive technology, Ambient Intelligence is ultimately directed towards humans and targeted at the mundane life made of an infinite richness of circumstances that cannot fully be considered and easily be anticipated. Most books, however, focus their analysis on, or deal largely with, the advancement of the technology and its potential only. This book offers a fresh, up-to-date, and holistic approach to Ambient Intelligence. As such, it addresses the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary aspects of the rapidly evolving field of Ambient Intelligence by seamlessly integrating and fusing it with artificial intelligence, cognitive science and psychology, social sciences, and humanities. It is divided into two main parts: Part 1 is about different permutations of enabling technologies as well as core computational capabilities, namely context awareness, implicit and natural interaction, and intelligent behavior. It details the existing and upcoming prerequisite technologies, and elucidates the application and convergence of major current and future computing trends. Part 2 is an accessible review and synthesis of the latest research in the human-directed sciences and computing and how these are intricately interrelated in the realm of Ambient Intelligence. It deals with the state-of-the-art human-inspired applications which show human-like understanding and exhibit intelligent behavior in relation to a variety of aspects of human functioning - states and processes. It describes and elaborates on the rich potential of Ambient Intelligence from a variety of interrelated perspectives and the plethora of challenges and bottlenecks involved in making Ambient Intelligence a reality, and also discusses the established knowledge and recent discoveries in the human-directed sciences and their application and convergence in the ambit of Ambient Intelligence computing. This seminal reference work is the most comprehensive of its kind, and will prove invaluable to students, researchers, and professionals across both computing and the human-directed sciences.</td>

Moreover, it is the place where old people suffer from most domestic injuries. This paper presents a novel design, implementation and assessment of a Smart Kitchen which provides Ambient Assisted Living services; a smart environment that increases elderly and disabled people's autonomy in their kitchen-related activities through context and user awareness, appropriate user interaction and artificial intelligence. It is based on a modular architecture which integrates a wide variety of home technology (household appliances, sensors, user interfaces, etc.) and associated communication standards and media (power line, radio frequency, infrared and cabled). Its software architecture is based on the Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi), which allows building a complex system composed of small modules, each one providing the specific functionalities required, and can be easily scaled to meet our needs. The system has been evaluated by a large number of real users (63) and carers (31) in two living labs in Spain and UK. Results show a large potential of system functionalities combined with good usability and physical, sensory and cognitive accessibility.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Combining ongoing Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technolog- ical developments (e.g. pervasive computing, wearable devices, sensor networks etc.) with user-centred design methods greatly increases the acceptance of the intelligent system and makes it more capable of pro- viding a better quality of life in a non-intrusive way. Elderly people could clearly benefit from this concept. Thanks to smart environments, they can experience considerable enhancements, giving them an opportunity to live more independently and for longer in their home rather than in a health-care centre. However, to implement such a system, it is essen- tial to know for whom we are designing. In this paper, we present an intelligent system with a monitoring infrastructure that will help mainly elderly users with impairments to overcome their handicap. The purpose of such a system is to create a safe and intuitive environment that will facilitate the achievement of household tasks in order to preserve inde- pendence of elderly residents for a while longer. Pursuing this goal, we propose to use the persona concept to help us build a user model based on the personas aptitudes. The practice of user modelling emphasizes the importance of user-centred techniques in any AmI system develop- ment and highlights the potential impacts of AmI for certain targeted groups - in this case, the elderly and people with disabilities.</td>

Ambient intelligence (AmI) research builds upon advances in sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial intelligence. Because these contributing fields have experienced tremendous growth in the last few years, AmI research has strengthened and expanded. Because AmI research is maturing, the resulting technologies promise to revolutionarize daily human life by making people's surroundings flexible and adaptive. In this paper, we provide a survey of the technologies that comprise ambient intelligence and of the applications that are dramatically affected by it. In particular, we specifically focus on the research that makes AmI technologies "intelligent". We also highlight challenges and opportunities that AmI researchers will face in the coming years. textcopyright 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The increasing need to access information everywhere and at any time leads us to believe that future user interfaces, through which users interact with pervasive computing systems, must address both device and modality independence. The pervasive computing paradigm sees almost every object in the everyday environment as a system able to communicate with users and other systems in their own languages. The interaction between users and systems is therefore typically multimodal. The main challenge of multimodal interaction, that is also the main topic of this paper, lies in developing a framework that is able to process information derived from whatever input modalities, giving these inputs an appropriate representation and integrating these individual representations into a joint semantic interpretation. A description of this multimodal pervasive framework will be given in this paper, along with some details of its application in Ambient Assisted Living and the usability test that was implemented to validate its effectiveness.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Location and tracking services and technologies are becoming fundamental components for supporting healthcare solutions. They facilitate patients' tracking and monitoring processes and also allow for better and long-term daily activity recognition. Various location and tracking services have been developed, over the last years, to provide real time localization for different applications. However, most of these services are not designed particularly to comply with all the requirements of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and, as a result, they reduce the viability of adopting AAL services as an alternative for continuous healthcare services. In this paper we set out the general requirements for location and tracking services for AAL. The requirements are extracted from a typical scenario of AAL. From the scenario, we define the requirements and also we identify a set of metrics to be used as evaluation criteria. If the identified requirements and metrics are adopted widely, potential location and tracking services will fit the real needs of AAL, and thus will increase the accessibility to AAL services by a larger sector of people. Moreover, in the paper, we evaluate two of the existing location techniques through the use of the proposed metrics. The aim is to asses to which level these solutions fulfill the identified requirements.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient Intelligence is a vision of the future information society stemming from the convergence of ubiquitous computing, ubiquitous communication and intelligent user-friendly interfaces. It offers an opportunity to realise an old dream, i.e. the smart or intelligent home. Will it fulfil the promises or is it just an illusion-offering apparently easy living while actually increasing the complexity of life? This article touches upon this question by discussing the technologies, applications and social implications of ambient intelligence in the home environment. It explores how Ambient Intelligence may change our way of life. It concludes that there are great opportunities for Ambient Intelligence to support social developments and modern lifestyles. However, in order to gain wide acceptance a delicate balance is needed: the technology should enhance the quality of life but not be seeking domination. It should be reliable and controllable but nevertheless adaptive to human habits and changing contexts. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

In addition we provide communication and delivery services in location-based manner using built in GPS, WiFi and 3G mobile connectivity. Bluetooth compatible blood pressure and body weight measurement devices are complemented with a body-mounted wireless physiological sensor to monitor activity, body temperature and stress. Telemetric data is continuously recorded on a local host computer while simultaneously being also sent to a central database, where a rule-based system or monitoring health personnel may make emergency assessment.</td>

The study focuses in particular on RDF stores, the software components dedicated to the storage, representation and retrieval of semantic information. Starting from a literature review, a qualitative analysis is carried out considering a set of these systems. RDF stores are evaluated to find the implementations that are best suited to play the role of backbone in a software architecture sharing information between the software tools adopted by the various stakeholders. This can be achieved if the architecture overcomes the problems deriving from the lack of integration between the involved software applications, providing in this way an integrated view on relevant engineering knowledge. textcopyright 2014 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient Intelligence (AmI) has emerged in the past 10 years as a multidisciplinary field within ubiquitous computing, attracting considerable research, funding and public attention and leading to many research groups, and conferences specifically focused on Ambient Intelligence topics. From its conception, AmI has always been a field strongly driven by a particular vision of how ICT technologies would shape our future. This has given the AmI vision, essentially as proposed by ISTAG, an excessively central role in shaping the field and setting its research agenda. We argue that this inspiring vision should no longer be the main driver for AmI research and that we should now re-interpret its role in the background of 10 years of research. In this paper, we reflect on what it means for AmI to move behind its foundational vision and we identify a number of emerging trends around some of its core concepts, more specifically the notion of intelligence, the system view and the requirements process. The main motivation is to search for alternative research directions that may be more effective in delivering today the essence of the AmI vision, even if they mean abandoning some of the currently prevailing approaches and assumptions. Overall, these trends provide a more holistic view of AmI and may represent important contributions for bringing this field closer to realisation, delivery and real social impact.</td>

Due to the high potential of emergencies, a sound emergency assistance is required, for instance assisting elderly people with comprehensive ambient assisted living solutions sets high demands on the overall system quality and consequently on software and system engineering – user acceptance and support by various userinterfaces is an absolute necessity. In this article, we present an Assisted Living Laboratory that is used to train elderly people to handle modern interfaces for Assisted Living and evaluate the usability and suitability of these interfaces in specific situations, e.g., emergency cases.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The development of ambient assisted living (AAL) systems, which are tailored to health or elder care, requires specific methods and tools. AAL systems make often use of wireless sensor networks, machine learning algorithms and sensory devices. Since wireless sensor networks and their sensors are inhomogeneous, it became apparent that such systems need to cope with different hardware platforms, different programming languages, unreliable wireless communication, energy constraints, data analysis algorithms, recognition of situations, and deployment options. Developers to date tend to use a bottom-up approach: hardware components dictate the development of AAL systems and thereby restrict the range of use cases that can be realized; domain experts by contrast would prefer a top-down approach and model the systempsilas functionality independently from the hardware platform. Currently available software development environments and tools do not adequately support domain experts and developers to accomplish these tasks efficiently. This paper presents methods that support domain experts in their top-down approach, as well as technically experienced developers in their bottom-up approach. The implemented tools enable a model-driven software development process (from platform-independent modeling to generating AAL application code) and thus facilitate programming AAL systems.</td>

A new global objective that aims towards enhancing the elderly quality of life appears where lot of research has been taking place in the field of ambient intelligence consideration factors which includes more comfort, improved health and security for the elderly while living in their homes longer. This paper describes steps towards that goal. Thus a new intelligent fuzzy agent have been created with an emotion aware system that transforms a living environment into a pseudo robot which within which they reside providing a non-invasive, self-learning, intelligent controlling system that constantly adapts to the requirements of an individual. The system developed aims to towards providing a level of care for those who have difficulty in their interaction with standardised living spaces and a comparison of the two different self-learning methodologies developed is discussed. The empirical results of experiments performed at the Glamorgan Intelligent Home Care (Glam i-Home Care) will be presented shown the potential of the approach in assisting the extension of independent living.</td>

Such situations are represented here as contexts inferred by multiple software agents out of the data gathered from sensors within a home. Sensors can give an incomplete, sometimes ambiguous, picture of the world; hence, they often lead to inconsistent contexts and unreliability on the system as a whole. We report on a solution to this problem based on a multi-agent system where each agent is able to support its under- standing of the context through arguments. These argu- ments can then be compared against each other to determine which agent provides the most reliable inter- pretation of the reality under observation.</td>

It is demonstrated that living assistance systems must realize flexibility and adaptability at the algorithmic, architectural and human interface level to an extent unknown in present systems. The construction of robust, trustworthy living assistance systems is an extremely challenging task and requires novel approaches for dependable self-adapting software architectures, resource efficiency, and self-adapting multi-modal human-computer interfaces.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient assisted living (AAL) is advocated as technological solutions that will enable the elderly population maintain their independence for a longer time than would otherwise be the case. Though the facts motivating the need for AAL are indisputable, the inherently heterogeneous nature and requirements of the elderly population raise significant difficulties. One particular challenge is that of designing AAL systems that can evolve to meet the requirements of individuals as their needs and circumstances change. This demands the availability of an adaptive, open, scalable software platform that incorporates a select combination of autonomic and intelligent techniques. Given that the first generation of AAL systems will be deployed in the near future, it is incumbent on designers to factor this need for evolution and adaptivity in their designs and implementations. Thus this paper explores AAL from a number of prospective and considers an agent-based middleware approach to realising an architecture for evolutionary AAL.</td>

AmI environments can be diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, vehicles, tourist attractions, stores, sports facilities, and music devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a testbed for AmI using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian OS. We analyze the performance of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in an indoor scenario. For evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Activity level as a metric to monitor the daily living of the elderly is often carried out using passive sensor networks. With the reduction of camera prices, there is a growing interest of video-based approaches in the domain of assisted living. In this paper the concept of activity level recognition in context of tracking the movement pattern of an individual is explored using a video-based framework at real time. Simple motion features are modelled over time and classified them into different activity levels using a neural network. For the experiments, the Sheffield Activities of Daily Living (SADL) dataset is used where each activity is simulated within a simulated assisted living environment under two different illumination conditions. Our experiments show that the detection rate for each of the activity level is well above 80% and the detection time is approximately 30 seconds.</td>

The system provides an interactive environment for people with special needs, based on ubiquitous sensing, individual-environment interaction, context awareness, and learning information systems. It provides a full cycle of processes, including sensing the individual's activity and behavior, preprocessing of sensors data, information aggregation, reasoning, and interaction with the individual and with external factors such as relatives and care services. The system is based on ambient intelligence, i.e. its infrastructure is pervasive, with a large number of distributed devices that communicate between themselves as well as with centralized services.</td>

Since young people are not capable of sustaining an adequate healthcare for elderly people, new healthcare fields have to be devised. Recent advances in information and communication technology enable the support of elderly people in their domestic environment. The EU project RADIO will design of an old age compliant smart home environment which specializes in fulfilling the needs of elderly people. This is partially achieved through a mobile robot platform which serves as an assistant to the respective elderly person. Apart from this, the robot also functions as a mobile sensor platform. Under this context, unobtrusiveness is of paramount importance since the robot should be a natural participant of patients' daily life. This paper discusses such a healthcare facility, analyses its requirements and poses the challenges towards this direction.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient assisted living (AAL) applications are intended to allow elderly people to stay at home while connected to their family and medical staff. These applications involve several services as health-care services or infotainment, which are executed on different environments such as hospital, proximity doctor, family homes. These environments constitute a distributed, heterogeneous, highly dynamic infrastructure that makes it necessary to build AAL applications as adaptive software including the necessary mechanisms to dynamically modify their behavior. In this paper we propose a multi-level model to build context-aware self-adaptive entities: the basic level defines the mandatory functionalities for adaptive entities, while upper-levels define how to coordinate adaptation of primitive or composite entities. The generic nature of the model is illustrated by its use when building a self-adaptive distributed data management service for an AAL application.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The ageing process of population of the First World coun- tries is increasing the interest towards solutions to improve the quality of life of elderly or disabled people and their families, providing an econom- ically sustainable healthcare. Thus Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Ambient Intelligence (AmI) are moving towards the Artificial Intelligence field to develop modular, adaptable and intelligent systems to cope with changing needs that characterize the life of people with chronic diseases. These systems should find smart and simple ways to improve the patient quality of life, enhancing at the same time the communication between the system, the assisted person, his family and the medical staff, acting also as a filter of information that provides useful and significant data. This paper introduces the basic architecture of an expert system for AAL: the Virtual Carer (VC). It has to be understood as an IT system modelling a distributed, reliable and modular sensor network composed by biometric and ambient sensors, being able to communicate with an assisted person, to monitor his health conditions and to control the en- vironment around him. The main goal of the system is to help an elderly patient with his daily activities ensuring his security. The proposed sys- tem is based on a multi-agent architecture to ensure its flexibility and interoperability: new devices or sensors can be added simply adding new agents, thanks to the standardization of agent communication. The sys- tem includes also a reasoning part based on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) paradigm, trying to model the behaviours of a human caregiver</td>

In the context of emergency sup- port, such a situation might be an acute emergency situation or a deviation from the usual behavior. To optimize prevention of emergencies, reliable recognition of characteristic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is promising. In this paper, we present our approach to processing information for the detection of ADLs in the EMERGE project. The approach is based on our multi-agent activity recog- nition framework EARS with its special definition language EARL. An evalua- tion with controlled experiments has proven its suitability.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The population of elderly people keeps increasing rapidly, which becomes a predominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and cost- effective need to be sought. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a new approach which promises to address the needs from elderly people. Ambient Intelligence technologies are widely developed in this domain aiming to construct safe environments around assisted peoples and help them maintain independent living. However, there are still many fundamental issues in AAL that remain open. Most of the current efforts still do not fully express the power of human being, and the importance of social connections and social activities is less noticed. Our conjecture is that such features are fundamental prerequisites towards truly effective AAL services. This paper reviews the current status of researches on AAL, discusses the promises and possible advantages of AAL, and also indicates the challenges we must meet in order to develop practical and efficient AAL systems for elderly people. In this paper, we also propose an approach to construct effective home-care system for the elderly people.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) describes an ICT based environment that exposes personalized and context-aware intelligent services, thus creating an appropriate experience to the end user to support independent living and improvement of the everyday quality of life of both healthy elderly and disabled people. The social and economic impact of AAL systems have boosted the research activities that combined with the advantages of enabling technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve the performance and the efficiency of such systems. Sensors and actuators inside buildings can create an intelligent sensing environments that help gather realtime data for the patients, monitor their vital signs and identify abnormal situations that need medical attention. AAL applications might be life critical and therefore have very strict requirements for their performance with respect to the reliability of the devices, the ability of the system to gather data from heterogeneous devices, the timeliness of the data transfer and their trustworthiness. This work presents the functional architecture of SOrBet (Marie Curie IAPP project) that provides a framework for interconnecting efficiently smart devices, equipping them with intelligence that helps automating many of the everyday activities of the inhabitants. SOrBet is a paradigm shift of traditional AAL systems based on a hybrid architecture, including both distributed and centralized functionalities, extensible, self-organising, robust and secure, built on the concept of “reliability by design”, thus being capable of meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of demanding applications such as AAL.</td>

This book addresses$nambient intelligence used to support human contacts and accompany$nan individual's path through the complicated modern world. From the$ntechnical standpoint, distributed electronic intelligence is addressed$nas hardware vanishing into the background. Devices used for ambient$nintelligence are small, low-power, low weight, and (very importantly)$nlow-cost; they collaborate or interact with each other; and they$nare redundant and error-tolerant. This means that the failure of$none device will not cause failure of the whole system. Since wired$nconnections often do not exist, radio methods will play an important$nrole for data transfer. This book addresses various aspects of ambient$nintelligence, from applications that are imminent since they use$nessentially existing technologies, to ambitious ideas whose realization$nis still far away, due to major unsolved technical challenges.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A new and innovative system intended for the monitoring of the elderly and those requiring passive care is developed, with a wrist-wearable wireless sensor node and a mobile platform to form a remotely accessible body area network. The system utilises a state-of-the art SoC (System on Chip), using an ultra-low power sensor interface and RF communication. Ambient/skin temperatures, accelerations and heart rate of the wearer are measured for real-time monitoring. Due to the high dimension and nonlinearity of the collected sensor data, a classifier with a dimension reduction technique is proposed for robust behaviour identification of a wearer. Experiments verify that the proposed classifier outperforms the conventional classifiers in its one-pass training and with higher distinguishing capability. The device functions unobtrusively, whilst giving the user peace of mind in the knowledge that their safety is being monitored.</td>
