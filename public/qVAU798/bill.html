<p1>Autobiography of Bill Gates</p1>
</center>
<br><br>

<div class="floating-box">William Henry Gates was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington. As the principal founder
 of Microsoft, Bill Gates is one of the most influential and richest people on the planet. Recent
 estimates of his wealth put it at $56 billion, this is the equivalent of the combined GDP of several
 African economies. In recent years he has retired from working full time at Microsoft, and has
 instead has concentrated on working with his charitable foundation “The Bill and Melinda Gates
 Foundation”.<br><br>Bill GatesBill Gates founded Microsoft in 1976 when he formed a contract with MITTS
 (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) to develop a basic operating system for their new
 microcomputers. In the early days Bill Gates would review every line of code. He was also involved
 in several aspects of Microsoft’s business such as packing and sending off orders.<br><br>The big break for Microsoft came in 
 1980 when IBM approached them for a new BASIC operating system
 for its new computers. In the early 1980s IBM was by far the leading PC manufacture. However,
 increasingly, there developed many IBM PC clones; (PCs developed by other companies compatible
 with IBM’s). Microsoft worked hard to sell its operating system to these other companies. Thus
 Microsoft was able to gain the dominant position of software manufacture just as the personal
 computer market started to boom. Since its early dominance, no other company has come close
 to displacing Microsoft as the dominant provider of computer operating software.<br><br>In 1990 Microsoft released its first
 version of Windows. This was a break through in operating
 software as it replaced text interfaces with graphical interfaces. It soon became a best seller
 and was able to capture the majority of the operating system market share. In 1995 Windows 95 was
 released, setting new standards and features for operating systems. This version of windows has
 been the backbone of all future releases from Windows 2000 to the latest XP and Vista.<br><br>Throughout his time in office Bill
 Gates has been keen to diversify the business of Microsoft.
 For example Microsoft’s Internet Explorer became the dominant web browser, although this is mainly
 because it comes pre installed on most new computers, and in recent years has seen its market share
 slip.</div>

<p1>Autobiography of Steve Jobs</p1>
</center>
<br><br>

<div class="floating-box">Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, 
inventor, and industrial designer. He was the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO)
 of Apple Inc.; CEO and majority shareholder of Pixar;[2] a member of The Walt Disney Company's board
 of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is
 widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with
 Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.<br><br>Jobs was adopted at birth in San Francisco, and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area during
 the 1960s.
 Jobs briefly attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out. He then decided to travel 
through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. Jobs's declassified FBI
 report says an acquaintance knew that Jobs used illegal drugs in college including marijuana and
 LSD. Jobs told a reporter once that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most important things"
 he did in his life.<br><br>Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The duo gained fame and
 wealth a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal
 computers. In 1979, after a tour of PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto,
 which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to development of the
 unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984. In addition to
 being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI, the Macintosh instigated the sudden rise of
 the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first
 laser printer to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out
 of Apple in 1985.<br><br>After leaving Apple, Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
 development company specializing in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business
 markets. In addition, Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects industry when
 he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986.[9]
 The new company, Pixar, would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film, Toy
 Story—an event made possible in part because of Jobs's financial support.<br><br>In 1997, Apple acquired and merged NeXT, allowing
 Jobs to become CEO once again, reviving the
 company at the verge of bankruptcy. Beginning in 1997 with the "Think different" advertising
 campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that
 would have larger cultural ramifications: the iMac, iTunes and iTunes Store, Apple Store,
 iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. Mac OS was also revamped into OS X (renamed “macOS”
 in 2016), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform.
Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died of respiratory arrest
 related to the tumor on October 5, 2011.</div>
