    <p id="para">I am Mohamed Zakaria. I love good content, smart marketing and creative community building. I love making fun of people ;)

At this moment, I am in my final year in BIS, Helwan University, a perfect place to improve my skills in accounting, finance and cooperation business. Beside my academic life, I participated in student activities e.g. Fekrathon BIS as a destination to interact with the community and practice and improve my hobbies  as photography and social media managing. There, I focused on proffesional support, hapiness and making sure I had the best time of my life. :)

I participated in various courses and trainings in the marketing and banking business. I was honored to be a trainee at QNB ALAHLI where I improved my customer service and operations skills. I was lucky too to attend Update - Cairo University marketing course as well where I improved my marketing skills.

I'm originally from Cairo, so I try to take advantage of everything that the capital has to offer. When I'm not making magic at my desk, you're likely to find me expoloring new places, eating my way through downtown streets and its surronding suburbs, or taking a drive along the nile river cornishe. My camera rarely leaves my side.</p>
