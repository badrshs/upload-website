	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a real-time, low-cost system to localize a mobile robot in outdoor environments. Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion in real time (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman filter to prevent long-term drifts. Experimental results are presented for outdoor localization in moderately sized environments (ges100 meters).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: An autonomous mobile robot must face the correspondence or data association problem in order to carry out tasks like place recognition or unknown environment mapping. In order to put into correspondence two maps, most correspondence methods first extract early features from robot sensor data, then matches between features are searched and finally the transformation that relates the maps is estimated from such matches. However, finding explicit matches between features is a challenging and computationally expensive task. In this paper, we propose a new method to align obstacle maps without searching explicit matches between features. The maps are obtained from a stereo pair. Then, we use a vocabulary tree approach to identify putative corresponding maps followed by a Newton minimization algorithm to find the transformation that relates both maps. The proposed method is evaluated on a typical office dataset showing good performance.</td>

Most robot hands have small size simultaneously many joints as compared with robot manipulators. Components of actuator, gear, and sensors used for building robots are not small and are expensive, and those make it difficult to build a small sized robot hand. Differently from conventional development of robot hands, KITECH hand adopts a RC servo module that is cheap, easily obtainable, and easy to handle. The RC servo module that have been already used for several small sized humanoid can be new solution of building small sized robot hand with many joints. The feasibility of KITECH hand in object manipulation is shown through various experimental results. It is verified that the modified RC servo module is one of effective solutions in the development of a robot hand.</td>

Two different solid-state gyroscopes have been evaluated for estimating the orientation of the robot. Performance of the gyroscopes with error models is compared to the performance when the error models are excluded from the system. Similar error models have been developed for each axis of a solid-state triaxial accelerometer and for a conducting-bubble tilt sensor which may also be used as a low-cost accelerometer. An integrated inertial platform consisting of three gyroscopes, a triaxial accelerometer and two tilt sensors is described.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Vision systems employing region segmentation by color are crucial in real-time mobile robot applications. With careful attention to algorithm efficiency, fast color image segmentation can be accomplished using commodity image capture and CPU hardware. This paper describes a system capable of tracking several hundred regions of up to 32 colors at 30 Hz on general purpose commodity hardware. The software system consists of: a novel implementation of a threshold classifier, a merging system to form regions through connected components, a separation and sorting system that gathers various region features, and a top down merging heuristic to approximate perceptual grouping. A key to the efficiency of our approach is a new method for accomplishing color space thresholding that enables a pixel to be classified into one or more, up to 32 colors, using only two logical AND operations. The algorithms and representations are described, as well as descriptions of three applications in which it has been used.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Instrumenting the physical world through large networks of wireless sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmental monitoring of water and soil, requires that these nodes be very small, lightweight, untethered, and unobtrusive. The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.</td>

The use of products from the market makes building robots possible at a very low-cost awakening the engineering nature of students and researchers. In this paper we present a low cost mobile robot which uses a normal laptop to guide itself through a track. The low cost robot involves the use of one or more cameras to control the position of the robot's position relative to the environment. Motors are from battery operated screwdrivers and the interface with the laptop is based on an USB card, recently made available from a data acquisition cards manufacturer. The goal for this work is to build a large set of these robots, lend them to the engineering students and make them participate in a local university contest. Moreover, along the years, the student integrates more and more knowledge in the robot allowing it to perform as better as their knowledge increases along the course.</td>

Using solid-state magnetic sensors and a tilt sensor, a low cost compass system can be realized. Commercial airlines today use attitude and heading reference systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars. For general aviation, or small private aircraft, this is too costly for most pilot's budget. The compass system described here provides heading, pitch and roll outputs accurate to one degree, or better. The shortfall of this low-cost approach is that the compass outputs are affected by acceleration and turns. A solution to this problem is also presented.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Increase robot utilization may be viewed in term of low -cost designs and operations, which are based on the use of products from the market for the robot components. Low-cost robots are related to new emerging application areas. The market components give the possibility to build robots at a low price but they also reduce the capability of robots to specific tasks. Low-cost robots can be also operated in a simpler way compared to the typical industrial robots. In this paper, an overview is presented on low-cost robots by discussing basic characteristics, applications, and motivation for a future success. The importance of low-cost robots can be recognized in the fact that they can be available everywhere at different level of cost and complexity. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to suggest the use of low-cost robots both for teaching and investigation to any teacher and researcher in any Institution with the possibility to achieve significant results both in teach ing and research activities. Particular attention has been addressed to research and teaching activities in University Institutions with the aim to stress the fundamental role of engineers formation in Robotics by using low-cost robots with even novel solutions for. Examples of a successful activity by using low-cost robots have been illustrated as those developed at LARM, the Laboratory of Robotics and Mechatronics in Cassino, Italy.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Hyper-redundant manipulators can be fragile, expensive, and limited in their flexibility due to the distributed and bulky actuators that are typically used to achieve the precision and degrees of freedom (DOFs) required. Here, a manipulator is proposed that is robust, high-force, low-cost, and highly articulated without employing traditional actuators mounted at the manipulator joints. Rather, local tunable stiffness is coupled with off-board spooler motors and tension cables to achieve complex manipulator configurations. Tunable stiffness is achieved by reversible jamming of granular media, which-by applying a vacuum to enclosed grains-causes the grains to transition between solid-like states and liquid-like ones. Experimental studies were conducted to identify grains with high strength-to-weight performance. A prototype of the manipulator is presented with performance analysis, with emphasis on speed, strength, and articulation. This novel design for a manipulator-and use of jamming for robotic applications in general-could greatly benefit applications such as human-safe robotics and systems in which robots need to exhibit high flexibility to conform to their environments.</td>

A simple DR construction is adopted to improve the performance of both pure land DR navigation and DR/GPS integration system. In order to overcome the flaws of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the sigma-point KF (SPKF) is merged with the receding-horizon strategy. This filter has several advantages over the EKF, the SPKF, and the RHKF filter. The advantages include the robustness to the system model uncertainty, the initial estimation error, temporary unknown bias, etc. The computational burden is reduced. Especially, the proposed filter works well even in the case of exiting the unmodeled random walk of the inertial sensors, which can occur in the microelectromechanical systems' inertial sensors by temperature variation. Therefore, the SPRHKF filter can provide the navigation information with good quality in the DR/GPS integration system for land navigation seamlessly</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Ensuring the long term viability of reef environments requires essential monitoring of many aspects of these ecosystems. However, the sheer size of these unstructured environments (for example Australia's Great Barrier Reef) pose a number of challenges for current monitoring platforms which are typically remote operated and required significant resources and infrastructure. Therefore, a primary objective of the CSIRO robotic reef monitoring project is to develop and deploy a large number of AUV teams to perform broadscale reef surveying. In order to achieve this, the platforms must be cheap, even possibly disposable. This work presents the results of a preliminary investigation into the performance of a low-cost sensor suite and associated processing techniques for vision and inertial-based navigation within a highly unstructured reef environment.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we describe a system that enables a low-cost quadrocopter coupled with a ground-based laptop to navigate autonomously in previously unknown and GPS-denied environments. Our system consists of three components: a monocular SLAM system, an extended Kalman filter for data fusion and state estimation and a PID controller to generate steering commands. Next to a working system, the main contribution of this paper is a novel, closed-form solution to estimate the absolute scale of the generated visual map from inertial and altitude measurements. In an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our system is able to navigate in previously unknown environments at absolute scale without requiring artificial markers or external sensors. Furthermore, we show (1) its robustness to temporary loss of visual tracking and significant delays in the communication process, (2) the elimination of odometry drift as a result of the visual SLAM system and (3) accurate, scale-aware pose estimation and navigation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: GPS and low-cost INS sensors are widely used for positioning and attitude determination applications. Low-cost inertial sensors exhibit large errors that can be compensated using position and velocity updates from GPS. Combining both sensors using a Kalman filter provides high-accuracy, real-time navigation. A conventional Kalman filter relies on the correct definition of the measurement and process noise matrices, which are generally defined a priori and remain fixed throughout the processing run. Adaptive Kalman filtering techniques use the residual sequences to adapt the stochastic properties of the filter on line to correspond to the temporal dependence of the errors involved. This paper examines the use of three adaptive filtering techniques. These are artificially scaling the predicted Kalman filter covariance, the Adaptive Kalman Filter and Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation. The algorithms are tested with the GPS and inertial data simulation software. A trajectory taken from a real marine trial is used to test the dynamic alignment of the inertial sensor errors. Results show that on line estimation of the stochastic properties of the inertial system can significantly improve the speed of the dynamic alignment and potentially improve the overall navigation accuracy and integrity.</td>

This paper presents the real-time results of applying a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver for the GNC. The INS/GPS navigation loop provides continuous and reliable navigation solutions to the guidance and flight control loop for autonomous flight. With additional air data and engine thrust data, the guidance loop computes the guidance demands to follow way-point scenarios. The flight control loop generates actuator signals for the control surfaces and thrust vector. The whole GNC algorithm was implemented within an embedded flight control computer. The real-time flight test results show that the vehicle can perform the autonomous flight reliably even under high maneuvering scenarios.</td>

The build cost of this device, using COTS electronics and custom mechanical tooling, is under $30.</td>

In the last years human–robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.</td>

This prototype is designed to provide mobile robot swarms with advanced sensing capabilities in an efficient, cost-effective way. From the observation of bats' foraging behaviors, the prototype with a particular emphasis on variable rotation range and speed, as well as 360° observation capability has been developed. The prototype also aims at giving each robot reliable information about identification of neighboring robots from objects and their positions. For this purpose, an observation algorithm-based sensor is proposed. The implementation details are explained, and the effectiveness of the control schemes is verified through extensive experiments. The sensor provides real-time location of stationary targets positioned 100 cm away within an average error of 2.6 cm. Moreover, experimental results show that the prototype observation capability can be quite satisfactory for practical use of mobile robot swarms.</td>

This paper describes two low-cost robotic wheelchair prototypes that assist the operator of the chair in avoiding obstacles, going to pre-designated places, and maneuvering through doorways and other narrow or crowded areas. These systems can be interfaced to a variety of input devices, and can give the operator as much or as little moment by moment control of the chair as they wish. This paper describes both systems, the evolution from one system to another, and the lessons learned.</td>

Indeed, mobile robots are getting increasingly complex and accessible. They embed elements from diverse ﬁelds such as mechanics, digital electronics, automatic control, signal processing, embedded programming, and energy management. Moreover, they are attractive for students which increases their motivation to learn. However, the requirements of an effective education tool bring new constraints to robotics. This article presents the e-puck robot design, which specifically targets engineering education at university level. Thanks to its particular design, the e-puck can be used in a large spectrum of teaching activities, not strictly related to robotics. Through a systematic evaluation by the students, we show that the e-puck ﬁts this purpose and is appreciated by 90 percent of a large sample of students.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The relatively high cost of inertial navigation systems (INSs) has been preventing their integration with global positioning systems (GPSs) for land-vehicle applications. Inertial sensors based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology have recently become commercially available at lower costs. These relatively lower cost inertial sensors have the potential to allow the development of an affordable GPS-aided INS (INS/GPS) vehicular navigation system. While MEMS-based INS is inherently immune to signal jamming, spoofing, and blockage vulnerabilities (as opposed to GPS), the performance of MEMS-based gyroscopes and accelerometers is significantly affected by complex error characteristics that are stochastic in nature. To improve the overall performance of MEMS-based INS/GPS, this paper proposes the following two-tier approach at different levels: (1) improving the stochastic modeling of MEMS-based inertial sensor errors using autoregressive processes at the raw measurement level and (2) enhancing the positioning accuracy during GPS outages by nonlinear modeling of INS position errors at the information fusion level using neuro-fuzzy (NF) modules, which are augmented in the Kalman filtering INS/GPS integration. Experimental road tests involving a MEMS-based INS were performed, which validated the efficacy of the proposed methods on several trajectories.</td>

This compliance makes the robot deflect due to the cutting forces, resulting in poor hole quality. Recently, functionality for high-bandwidth force control has found its way into industrial robot control systems. This could potentially open up the possibility of robotic drilling systems with improved performance, using only standard systems without costly extra hardware and calibration techniques. In this paper, we present methods and systems for force-controlled robot drilling, based on active suppression of drill sliding through a model-based force control scheme. The methods are validated in a number of drilling experiments using an industrial robot.</td>

In order to efficiently solve the task at hand, the robots often need accurate localization. In this work, we address the localization problem by developing a solution that has low computational and sensing requirements, and that is easily deployed on large robot teams composed of cheap robots. We build upon a real-time, particle-filter based localization algorithm that is completely decentralized and scalable, and accommodates realistic robot assumptions including noisy sensors, and asynchronous and lossy communication. In order to further reduce this algorithm's overall complexity, we propose a low-cost particle clustering method, which is particularly well suited to the collaborative localization problem. Our approach is experimentally validated on a team of ten real robots.</td>

The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth. The arm is used to demonstrate pancake cooking (pouring batter, flipping pancakes), using the intrinsic compliance of the arm to aid in interaction with objects.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Low-cost inertial sensors are characterized by high noise and large uncertainties in the outputs such as bias, scale factor and non-orthogonality. Consequently, errors associated with a low-cost INS in terms of position, velocity and attitude grow rapidly in stand-alone mode. If good performance can be achieved with low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs), cost in existing applications can be reduced and the development of new applications may be made feasible.<br>As most of the uncertainties exist in the sensor error behaviour, calibration would improve the accuracy significantly. Intensive calibration, however, would also increase the cost of using an IMU. Another way to improve the accuracy will be by augmenting the IMU with many other aiding sensors: for example, odometers or speedometers. Choosing an appropriate estimation method is a key problem when developing an aided INS. Currently, there are three approaches: (i) traditional linearized Kalman filter (LKF) or the extended Kalman filter (EKF); (ii) sampling-based filtering such<br>as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and particle filters; (iii) artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neural fuzzy information systems (ANFIS). Of these approaches,the performance of the UKF is compared to that of other existing methods. The performance of the unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) is also compared with that of the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother.<br>Tests have been conducted using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based IMUs. The most remarkable advantage of the UKF over existing methods is that it can handle large and small attitude errors seamlessly. Thus, the UKF is preferred in situations such as those where the heading error approaches the limit of what an EKF/LKF can deal with efficiently. The EKF/RTS approach would still be chosen if the attitude errors can be kept small such that the error dynamics are linear. The UKF can unify INS error models, although it cannot deal with complete uncertainties<br>in attitude Therefore, the development stage can be simplified by using the UKF.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Since the usage of high performance inertial navigation systems (INSs) is limited by their high price and the regulation by the government, low cost INSs are used for general application areas. However, low cost INSs can experience large positioning errors in very short time due to the low quality of the inertial measuring unit (IMU). To overcome the limitations of low cost INSs, several techniques were developed and tested using the NovAtel Black Diamond System (BDSTM).<br>A new field calibration method was developed and tested successfully. It is not needed to align the IMU to the local level frame with the method. Furthermore, the bias estimation of the calibration method is not affected by the reference gravity error. Almost half of the positioning error could be removed with the accelerometer calibration information.<br>The mechanization and navigation Kalman filter were implemented based on the navigation frame to test the velocity matching alignment and non-holonomic constraints. The velocity matching alignment technique was tested for the IMUs to which stationary alignment technique cannot be applied. All attitude components converged within three minutes with RMS 0.03◦. Non-holonomic constraints dramatically reduced the horizontal positioning error, within 40 m for 20 minutes operation. Therefore, low cost INSs can be used as a stand-alone positioning system during the GPS outages of over 10 minutes.</td>

There are three main con tributions: Firstly , the dev elopmen t of an aided inertial na vigation system using the Global Na vigation Satellite System (GNSS) as an aiding source for use in autonomous land v ehicles. This is accomplished b y using a Kalman lter as the estimation algorithm along with the addition of fault detection tec hniques so as to increase the in tegrit y of the system. The real time structure of the na vigation arc hitecture is pro vided along with results of its implemen tation in an autonomous 65 tonne straddle carrier. Ho w ev er, the algorithm dev elopmen t pro vides a generic structure th us allo wing the use of the na vigation suite on an y land v ehicle. Secondly is the use of v ehicle mo delling to b ound drift errors asso ciated with inertial na vigation. This pro vides a sensor-free aiding source due to the inheren t constrained motion of land v ehicles. V ehicle constrain ts can th us be used as an extra aiding source with other sensors whic h in turn impro v es the accuracy and in tegrit y of the o v erall na vigation system. This is demonstrated with the real time implemen tation of an inertial na vigation system b eing aided b y three separate aiding sources; GNSS, v ehicle mo delling and sp eed data pro vided b y an enco der. Finally , the understanding of the e ect of inertial sensor redundancy to na vigation accuracy and fault detection is addressed. A redundan t inertial measuremen t unit is dev elop ed and tested and pro vides the necessary ph ysical sensor for future fault detec- tion w ork. This concludes this thesis b y pro viding the foundation for the autonomous detection of faults in inertial units and furthermore the nal lev el of in tegrit y required for a na vigation system.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Full or partial loss of function in the upper limb is an increasingly common due to sports injuries, occupational injuries, spinal cord injuries, and strokes. Typically treatment for these conditions relies on manipulative physiotherapy procedures which are extremely labour intensive. Although mechanical assistive device exist for limbs this is rare for the upper body.<p>In this paper we describe the construction and testing of a seven degree of motion prototype upper arm training/rehabilitation (exoskeleton) system. The total weight of the uncompensated orthosis is less than 2 kg. This low mass is primarily due to the use of a new range of pneumatic Muscle Actuators (pMA) as power source for the system. This type of actuator, which has also an excellent power/weight ratio, meets the need for safety, simplicity and lightness. The work presented shows how the system takes advantage of the inherent controllable compliance to produce a unit that is extremely powerful, providing a wide range of functionality (motion and forces over an extended range) in a manner that has high safety integrity for the patient. A training control scheme is introduced which is used to control the orthosis when used as exercise facility. Results demonstrate the potential of the device as an upper limb training, rehabilitation and power assist (exoskeleton) system.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Skid-steered mobile robots are widely used because of their simple mechanism and high reliability. Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of such a robotic platform is, however, challenging due to the complex wheel/ground interactions and kinematic constraints. In this paper, we develop a kinematic modeling scheme to analyze the skid-steered mobile robot. Based on the analysis of the kinematics of the skid-steered mobile robot, we reveal the underlying geometric and kinematic relationships between the wheel slips and locations of the instantaneous rotation centers. As an application example, we also present how to utilize the modeling and analysis for robot positioning and wheel slip estimation using only low-cost strapdown inertial measurement units. The robot positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) design that incorporates the kinematic constraints for accuracy enhancement. The performance of the EKF-based positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme are also presented. The estimation methodology is tested and validated experimentally on a robotic test bed.</td>
