<h2>They’re passionate about solving for the customer</h2>

A good product marketer needs to have a deep empathy for customer pain and be passionate about solving them.<br/>

benefits that meet customers’ needs.
<br/>
<h2>They can lead cross functionally</h2>

skills are vital. Product marketers need to know how to work with and align these teams and be able lead each group toward the same goals.
<br/>
<h2>They’re technical</h2>

In order to lead cross functionally, product marketers need the technical skills to effectively communicate and plan projects<br/>
with design and product teams. They also need to understand the technical elements of a product in order to communicate how they<br/>
work and what benefits they bring to the customer.
<br/>
<h2>They’re great writers</h2>

Great products with great features are awesome, but only if the customer understands them. Product marketers need to be able<br/>
to communicate the benefits of complex features and updates and make them easy for customers to get started with. <br/>
Adoption and demand for a product rely heavily on great writing.
<br/>
<h2>They thrive in ambiguity</h2>

Since product marketing as a whole is hard to define, the day-to-day of a PMM can be, too. Being able to navigate an unstructured<br/> 
environment is a must in order to find and act on opportunities to improve the customer’s experience. They need to determine which<br/>
teams within the company they need to start a dialogue with and start working with them without any instruction.
<br/>
<h2>They’re creative problem solvers</h2>

Drawing solutions from input across multiple teams requires some creativity. A good PMM needs both creative and analytical skills <br/>
to connect data points from a number of sources and come up with out-of-the-box solutions that customers need and respond to.
