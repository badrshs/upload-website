        <h2 id="no1">Snooping, data leaks and the threat to online privacy</h2>
        <p>In a news cycle still fixated on the US election result, on November 15 members of the UK's upper house of parliament gave final approval to the country's most invasive surveillance legislation to date. The Investigatory Powers Act gives government agencies unprecedented powers to collect user information in bulk and access data about the websites that Britons visit. The most controversial aspect of the law is the requirement for internet service providers (ISP) to hold information about every website a user visits for 12 months. Government agencies, such as the security services, the Inland Revenue, and even the Food Standards Agency, will be able to access the information, for what officials say will be a "limited set of specified purposes" subject to "strict controls". Despite the ease with which it passed through the Conservative-controlled legislative chambers, the law nicknamed the Snooper's Charter by the British press has prompted strong criticism.

        <h2 id="no2">Climate chaos: How El Nino changes the weather</h2>
        <p>El Nino, a powerful weather system, is responsible for the current climate chaos parts of the world have suffered over the past year, and continue to be affected by. Severe fires and drought leading to food shortages continue to plague 11 South Pacific countries, flooding in Central America has led to thousands of evacuations and sea life is disappearing from its natural habitat, only to reappear in new areas miles away. An El Nino is defined as an interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which happens in the tropical Pacific ocean, at the equator. There are different sizes of El Nino - with which the effects on the affected areas differ - ranging from small to medium, large and the 2015 El Nino, nicknamed the "Godzilla". El Ninos are also not to be confused with climate change. While an El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon, climate change is a man-made - some argue irreversible - trend created mostly via the emissions of greenhouse gases. Every three to seven years, the surface waters of the tropical Southern Pacific ocean either warm or cool by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius, creating weather conditions that are often the exact opposite of the norm. The El Nino Southern Oscillation, known as ENSO, is when the surface waters experience the warming. The reverse effect, as brought on by the cooling of the surface waters, is known as <em>La Nina</em>.

        <h2 id="no3">Drones launch off-grid healthcare in rural Madagascar</h2>
        <p>Drones, initially developed for warfare, are being co-opted to provide revolutionary off-grid healthcare to those who live in the most remote parts of the world. A fully autonomous drone recently flew blood samples from rural Madagascar to a central lab. The drone was developed by Vayu, a company founded by Daniel Pepper, which aims to bridge the gap between far-flung villages and healthcare that is so often centrally available, but out of reach for local inhabitants. Pepper discovered a chasm between medicinal availability and supply while working as a journalist in India. He recognised it was a major challenge for patients to travel to hospitals because of weather conditions, transport and family traditions there, and so he created Vayu with funds from governments, healthcare organisations and NGOs. Vayu's drones, which took two years to develop, are used to serve and connect rural villages to central hospitals. The company hopes to enable the off-grid villages to diagnose and treat the conditions via drone-delivered test samples and vaccines, preventing unnecessary deaths and illnesses.
        "The biggest hurdle has been regulatory rather than technical," said Pepper. "Currently, no countries provide blanket permission for beyond-line-of-sight autonomous flight." This means that Vayu and its partners work individually with national governments to overcome bans. Though regulation was not the only issue that Vayu encountered.

        <h2 id="no4">Can ecstasy drug therapy help cure PTSD?</h2>
        <p>Illegal club drug molly, or ecstasy, has been one of the most popular party drugs since the 1980s.Scientifically known as MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), ecstasy is a psychoactive drug, which was first developed as a blood clotting agent, later patented as a diet drug. When taken, it acts on the brain by causing neurons to release more serotonin. This also causes the neurotransmitter dopamine, as well as hormones such as oxytocin to be released, all leading to a heightened feeling of trust and compassion, which is why the drug is often called an empathogen. "I think people like taking MDMA because it makes you feel euphoric, it makes you feel like your anxiety is released, feelings of happiness. You can't talk about MDMA without talking about love and that's essentially why people take it," club goer Joseph Petitt says. The military once used the drug as what they imagined could be a truth serum, and now there is evidence that suggests it could help  post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, sufferers. "Treating PTSD virtually always involves revisiting the trauma in a therapeutic setting, and if they are not emotionally engaged enough, then the therapy doesn't work. So we think that MDMA seems to have this interesting combination of helping decrease fear and defensiveness at the same time," Dr Michael Mithoefer, a private psychiatrist using MDMA in psychotherapy to treat PTSD, explains.

        <h2 id="no5">Journey to the Arctic</h2>
        <p>The Arctic is warming up at twice the rate of the rest of the globe. Summer sea ice has receded by almost 25 percent since 1979, with the sea change becoming ever more apparent and Arctic-native animals now visibly struggling in their prolonged search for shelter, ice and food. Offshore oil exploration and increased tourism have also contributed to the speed at which environmental changes are occurring in the Arctic, with the fear of an ice-free summer on the horizon looming over the fate of the area. These changes have also been spotted on land, with melting permafrost causing entire patches of land and manmade structures to sink as the earth softens. Proximity to land and resources also presents a challenge, not only in times of emergency on the water, but also in executing the research required to understand and attempt to combat the effects of global warming on the Arctic. This is where the Polar-class icebreakers factor in. The United States owns only two icebreakers that are able to breach the density of ice formations the Arctic is known for. Weighing in at 16,000 tonnes and with the ability to reach 30,000 horsepower, they are a force to be reckoned with on the open seas.

        <h2 id="no6">Choking the planet: The problem with plastic</h2>
        <p>The world is addicted to plastic. It was once sold to consumers as the product of the future, a symbol of the modern times to come. But decades later the reality is that the earth is choking on it. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, only 9 percent of plastic is making its way into the recycling stream. "That's a people problem. They throw it on the street, or throw it in the ocean. Unfortunately it's a habit that has to be stopped," says Leon Farahnik, chairman of Carbonlite. Americans consume water from 50 billion of plastic bottles ever year. And a lot of plastic bottles end up in landfills instead of recycling facilities. It was a product developed for convenience, but now we are paying the price. "If you look at the population as a whole, probably the majority have not realised the magnitude of the problem," says Dr Steven Nutt, a professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Southern California. But why is a material that's designed to be used over and over again not being recycled? What happens to all the plastic? What is the impact on communities? What can be done to tackle the growing problem with plastic? And what would modern life be like without plastic?
