    <h1>Sports</h1>
<p>Sports is my comfort zone, i spent everything i got, money, time all i have on sports as it is my life
It started when i was a child i learned how to swim and reached to the club team, then i left the team and joined karate classes and reached to black belt (komote), after that i have won Cairo championship at the first rank, after all of this i left karate and joined another Aiekido, little brief about that game, aiekido means how to break human bones or how to defence yourself so i liked that game and get the orange belt after that I liked to reach a high level and concentrate my efforts on fitness and defence myself.<br>
One day my friend told me about a game mixed with fitness and defence so I googled it and found MMA (mixed martial arts) that contains Seven games mixed together :-<br>
1.	Street Fight<br>
2.	Judo<br>
3.  football<br>
4.  tennis<br>
Then I got bored from that violence so I decided to join the football team in my club but I made a surgery in my knee so I got a break for a while…
I decided to pay for a membership in the gym, in the first week my weight was 90 kg, with 26% fats, I trained hard and eat clean to get on the shape, after 2 Months I reached to 81 kg with 21% fats 50% pure muscles and it was a great achievement for me
I thank god for everything I’ve done in this life and for many blessings I have.
