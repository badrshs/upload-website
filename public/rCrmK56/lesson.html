<div class="floating-box"><i>GUI - </i>Short for the Graphical User Interface, a GUI (Pronounced as either G-U-I or gooey) Allows
 the use of icons or other visual indicators to interact with electronic devices, rather than using onty text via the command line.
 For example, all versions of Microsoft Windows utilize a GUI, where as MS-DOS does not. The GUI was first developed at Xerox PARC
 by Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, and a group of other researchers in 1981. Later, Apple introduce the Lisa computer, the first
 comercial available computer, on January and an example of GUI. <br><br><i>KERNEL - </i>The Kernel (also called nucleus) is a
 computerprogram that constitutes the central core ofa computers operating system It has complete control over everythong that
 occurs in the system. As such, It is the first program loaded on startup, and then manages the remainersof the stsrtup, as well
 as input/output request from software, translating them into responsible for managing and communicating with computing periperhals,
 like printers, speakers, etc. The kernel is a fundamentals part of a modern computers operating system.<br>The critical code of the
 kernel is usually loaded into a protected area of memory, which prevents it from being overwritten by other, less frequently used
 parts of the operating system or by applications. The kernel performs its tasks, such as executing processes and handling
 interrupts, in kernel space, where as everything a user in a GUI (Graphical User Interface), is done in user space.<br>This
 separation prevents user data and kernel data from interfering with each other and thereby diminishing performance or causing
 the system to become unstable (and possibly crashing).<br>When a process makes requests of the kernel, the request is called a
 system call. Various kernel designs differ in how they manage system calls and resources. For example, a monopolithic kernel
 executes all the operating system instructions in the same address space in order to improve the performance (clarification needed)
 of the system. A micro kernel runs most of the operating system backgruod processes in user space, to make the operating system more
 modular and therefore, easier to maintain. (clarification needed).

on start up, and then manages the remainder of the start up, as well as input/ output requests from software, translating them into 
data processing instruction for the central processing unit. It is also responsible for managing memory, and for managing and communication 
with computing peripherals, like printers, speaker, etc. The kernel is a fundamental part of a modern computer's operating system. 
<br>The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a protected area of memory, which prevents it from being overwritten by other,
less frequently used parts of the operating system or by applications. The kernel performs its tasks, such as executing processes and

GUI (graphical user interface), is done in user space.

 <p1>File management system</p1>
 <br>
 <div class="floating-box">A file management system is a type of software that manages data files in a computer system. It has limited
capabilities and is designed to manage individual or group files, such as special office documents and records. It may display
report details, like owner, creation date, state of completion and similar features useful in an office environment.
<br>A file management system is also knows as a file manager.
<br>A file management system should not be confused with a file system, which manages all types of data and files in an operating 
system (OS), or a database management system (DBMS), which has relational database capabilities and includes a programming language 
for further data manipulation.
<br>A file management system's tracking component is key to the creation and management of this system, where documents containing 
various stages of processing are shared and interchanged on an ongoing basis.

 <p1>Single user system</p1>
 <br>
  <div class="floating-box">Single user mode is a mode in which a multi user computer operating system boots into a single 
super user. It is mainly used for maintenance of multi-user environments such as network servers. Some tasks may required exclusive 
access to shared resources, for example running fsck on a network share.This mode can also be used for security purposes-network
services are not run, eliminating the possibility of outside interference.On some system a lost super user password can be change 
by switching to single user mode, but not asking for the password in such circumstances is viewed as a security vulnerability.
</div>
<br>   
<p1>Multi-user, multi-tasking operating system</p1>
<br>
<div class="floating-box">On the previous page we talked about a single user working on their personal computer doing many different
tasks at the same time-effectively, a single user operating system which allows you to multi-task.
<br>Personal computers can multi-task very well, especially for the type of things that most of us want to do, for example, reading
emails, writing letters, working on spreadsheets, listening to music, surfing the web and watching videos.
<br>However, there comes a time when only a *really* powerful  computer will do the job in hand. For instance 
<br>You are an engineer or scientist and want run a forecast
<br>You are a financial person and want to work on thousands of stock market share movements 
<br>You work in a bank and want to handle customer accounts.
<br>You are an architect and want to see your full design 
<br>You work at an University as an academic along with hundreds of other academics 
<br>You are a film animator and want to work in 3D </div>
<br>
<p1>Task management system</p1>
<br>
<div class="floating-box">Task management is the process of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning,
testing, tracking and reporting. Task management can help either individuals achieve goals, or groups of individuals collaborated 
and share knowledge for the accomplishment of collective goals. Tasks are also differentiated by complexity, from low to high.
<br>Effective task management requires managing all aspects of a task, including its status, priority, time, human and financial
resources assignments,
recurrency, notification and so on. These can be lumped together broadly into  the basic activities of task management.
<br>Managing multiple individual or team tasks may require specialised software, for example work flow or project management 
software, for example work flow or project management software. In fact, many people believe that task management should serve as
a foundition for project management activities.
<br>Task management many form part of project management and process management and can serve as the foundation for efficient 
work flow in an organisation. Project managers adhering to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project 
schedule, and are usually good at directing team members and moving the project forward. </div>

	<div class="floating-box"> MICROSOFT WINDOWS 
	<br>Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a meta family of graphic operating system develop, marketed, and sold by 
Microsoft.It consists of several families of operating system, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing 
industry. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies,
e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 
Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.
<br>Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20,1985, as a graphical operating system 
shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interface (GUIs). Microsoft Windows came to 
dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market  with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced 
in 1984. On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system. However, in 2014, 
Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android, because of the massive growth in sales 
of android smart phones. In 2014, the number of Windows device sold were less than 25% of android devices sold. This comparisons, 
however, may not be fully relevant as the two operating system traditionally targeted different platforms.
<br>As of March 2016, the most recent version of Windows for PCs, tablets, smart phones and embedded devices is Windows 10. The most 
recent versions for server computers is Windows Server 2012 R2. A specialized version of Windows runs on the X box One game console. </div> 
<br>
   <p1>Mac OS</p1>
   <br>
   <div class="floating-box">Mac OS is a series of graphical user interface-based operating systems developed by
   Apple Inc. for their Mac line of computer system.
   <br>The original system was first introduced in 1984 as being integral to the original Macintosh, and referred to as the "System".
Referred to by its major revision starting with "System 6" and "System 7", Apple rebranded version 7.6 as "Mac OS" as part of their 
Macintosh clone program in 1996. The Macintosh, specifically its system software, is credited with having popularized the early 
graphical user interface concept.
<br>There are two architectural legacies of Mac OS. Up to major revision 9, from 1984 to 2000, it is historically known as classic
 Mac OS. Major version 10, from 2001 to present, was originally branded "Mac OS X", renamed to "OS X" in 2012, and announced to  
 be renamed to "macOS" in the upcoming version macOS Sierra. Both legacies share a general interface design, and there has been some 
overlap of application frame works for compatibility; but the two system have different origins and use deeply different architectures.</div>
<br>
 <p1>Linux OS (Operating System)</p1>
<br>
<div class="floating-box">The Linux open source operating system, or Linux OS, is a freely distribution, cross-platform operating 
system based on Unix that can be installed in PCs, laptops, netbook, mobile and tablet devices, video game consoles, servers,
supercomputers and more.
<br>The Linux OS is frequently package as a Linux distribution for both desktop and serve use, and includes the Linux kernel
(the core of the operating system) as well as supporting tools and libraries. Popular Linux OS distribution include Debain, Ubuntu,
Fedora,Red Hat and openSUSE.</div>
