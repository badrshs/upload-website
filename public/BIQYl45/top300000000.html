This algorithm determines both the correspondence between observed landmarks (in this case vertical edges in the environment) and a stored map, and computes the location of the robot using those correspondences. The primary advantages of this algorithm are its use of a single geometric tolerance to describe observation error, its ability to recognize ambiguous sets of correspondences, its ability to compute bounds on the error in localization, and fast execution. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on a mobile robot system. In several hundred trials it has never failed, and computes location accurate to within a centimeter in less than 0.5 s</td>

In this paper we present RADAR, a radio-frequency (RF)-based system for locating and tracking users inside buildings. RADAR operates by recording and processing signal strength information at multiple base stations positioned to provide overlapping coverage in the area of interest. It combines empirical measurements with signal propagation modeling to determine user location and thereby enable location-aware services and applications. We present experimental results that demonstrate the ability of RADAR to estimate user location with a high degree of accuracy</td>

Error models for the inertial sensors are generated and included in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimating the position and orientation of a moving robot vehicle. Two different solid-state gyroscopes have been evaluated for estimating the orientation of the robot. Performance of the gyroscopes with error models is compared to the performance when the error models are excluded from the system. Similar error models have been developed for each axis of a solid-state triaxial accelerometer and for a conducting-bubble tilt sensor which may also be used as a low-cost accelerometer. An integrated inertial platform consisting of three gyroscopes, a triaxial accelerometer and two tilt sensors is described</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The amplitude response of infrared (IR) sensors based on reflected amplitude of the surrounding objects is non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. As a result, the main use of IR sensors in robotics is for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, their inherently fast response is very attractive for enhancing the real-time operation of a mobile robot in, for instance, map building tasks. Thus, it seems that the development of new low-cost IR sensors able to accurately measure distances with reduced response times is worth researching. In this paper, a new IR sensor based on the light intensity back-scattered from objects and able to measure distances of up to 1 m is described. Also, the sensor model is described and the expected errors in distance estimates are analysed and modelled. Finally, the experimental results obtained are discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a proof-of-concept design for a low cost two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm that incorporates series elastic actuators (SEAs) with force sensing. The cost effective ness of the design will enable the construction of compliant manipulators for multi-robot systems with large populations. The arm assembly attaches to a commercially available mobile robot chassis to perform multi-robot coordination. In this work, we present the design of a robot arm and data from experiments to characterize the accuracy and resolution of the force sensing. We describe a force-following manipulation experiment using two robots. The experiment measures strain on a rigid bar between two robots. The data shows the feasibility of using SEAs for force sensing to reduce the strain in the bar. This is the first step towards a distributed force controller for multi robot object coordination with large numbers of robots.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Hyper-redundant manipulators can be fragile, expensive, and limited in their flexibility due to the distributed and bulky actuators that are typically used to achieve the precision and degrees of freedom (DOFs) required. Here, a manipulator is proposed that is robust, high-force, low-cost, and highly articulated without employing traditional actuators mounted at the manipulator joints. Rather, local tunable stiffness is coupled with off-board spooler motors and tension cables to achieve complex manipulator configurations. Tunable stiffness is achieved by reversible jamming of granular media, which-by applying a vacuum to enclosed grains-causes the grains to transition between solid-like states and liquid-like ones. Experimental studies were conducted to identify grains with high strength-to-weight performance. A prototype of the manipulator is presented with performance analysis, with emphasis on speed, strength, and articulation. This novel design for a manipulator-and use of jamming for robotic applications in general-could greatly benefit applications such as human-safe robotics and systems in which robots need to exhibit high flexibility to conform to their environments.</td>

The mechanism's monolithic, planar geometry is easily fabricated via planar manufacturing processes, enables compact packaging and incorporates a flexure mechanism for achieving small transmission ratios. The manipulator tolerates ±1 mm actuator misalignment with less than 0.1% full-scale position error. Measurements over a 100 nm × 100 nm × 100 nm work volume show resolution better than our measurement capability of 5 nm and open-loop parasitic errors less than 5 nm. Measurements over a 100 μm × 100 μm × 100 μm work volume show open loop errors less than 0.2% full-scale. The mechanism's equilateral symmetry and planar geometry make it possible to limit thermal drift in position and orientation to less than 23 nm and 4 μrad over a 30 min start up period. The nano-manipulator, built at US$ 2000 cost (excludes electronics), is used as an ultra-precision fiber optic aligner.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new method for improving the accuracy of inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on land vehicles. The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization. Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization. A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an efficient localization scheme for an indoors mobile robot using Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems. The mobile robot carries an RFID reader at the bottom of the chassis, which reads the RFID tags on the floor to localize the mobile robot. Each of the RFID tags stores its own absolute position, which is used to calculate the position, orientation, and velocity of the mobile robot. However, a localization system based on RFID technology inevitably suffers from an estimation error. In this paper, a new triangular pattern of arranging the RFID tags on the floor has been proposed to reduce the estimation error of the conventional square pattern. In addition, the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot has been utilized to improve the localization accuracy of the mobile robot. According to the conventional approach, two readers are necessary to identify the orientation of the mobile robot. Therefore, this new approach, based on the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot, provides a cheap and fast estimation of the orientation. The proposed algorithms used to raise the accuracy of the robot localization are successfully verified through experiments.</td>

This prototype is designed to provide mobile robot swarms with advanced sensing capabilities in an efficient, cost-effective way. From the observation of bats' foraging behaviors, the prototype with a particular emphasis on variable rotation range and speed, as well as 360° observation capability has been developed. The prototype also aims at giving each robot reliable information about identification of neighboring robots from objects and their positions. For this purpose, an observation algorithm-based sensor is proposed. The implementation details are explained, and the effectiveness of the control schemes is verified through extensive experiments. The sensor provides real-time location of stationary targets positioned 100 cm away within an average error of 2.6 cm. Moreover, experimental results show that the prototype observation capability can be quite satisfactory for practical use of mobile robot swarms.</td>

A low-cost selective compliant articulated robotic arm designed for liquid spillage avoidance is developed here. In the vertical-plane robotic arm movement test, the signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and accelerometer were able to sense collisions. In the horizontal movement test, however, only the signals from the IMU enabled collision to be detected. Using a calculation method developed, it was possible to chart the regions where the obstacle was likely to be located when a collision occurred. The low cost of the IMU and its easy incorporation into the robotic arm offer the potential to meet the pressures of lowering operating costs, apply laboratory automation in resource-limited venues, and obviate human intervention in response to sudden disease outbreaks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Instrumenting the physical world through large networks of wireless sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmen- tal monitoring of water and soil, requires that these nodes be very small, light, untethered and unobtrusive. The problem of localization, i.e., de- termining where a given node is physically located in a network is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applica- tions. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS (Global Positioning System) on all nodes in these networks. In this paper, we review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity-metric method for localization in outdoor environ- ments that makes use of the inherent radio-frequency (RF) communi- cations capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, that is more ro- bust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then depen- dent on the separation distance between two adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimen- tal results show that the accuracy for 90% of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.</td>

The arm is unique in that it achieves reasonable performance for the envisioned tasks (backlash-free, sub-3mm repeatability, moves at 1.5m/s, 2kg payload) but with a significantly lower parts cost than comparable manipulators. The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth. The arm is used to demonstrate pancake cooking (pouring batter, flipping pancakes), using the intrinsic compliance of the arm to aid in interaction with objects.</td>

Instead of using an absolute positioning approach with fixed beacons in the operating environment, we have developed a ultrasonic relative positioning system that allows each robot to perceive the distance and the angle of other nearby robots in relation to its own position. The system is based on time-of-flight evaluation of ultrasonic pulses and a RF communication link. The system has a precision of 8 mm and of 3deg over a 6.7 m range.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot manipulator designs are increasingly focused on low cost approaches, especially those envisioned for use in unstructured environments such as households, office spaces and hazardous environments. The cost of angular sensors varies based on the precision offered. For tasks in these environments, millimeter order manipulation errors are unlikely to cause drastic reduction in performance. In this paper, estimates the joint angles of a manipulator using low cost triaxial accelerometers by taking the difference between consecutive acceleration vectors. The accelerometer-based angle is compensated with a uniaxial gyroscope using a complementary filter to give robust measurements. Three compensation strategies are compared: complementary filter, time varying complementary filter, and extended Kalman filter. This sensor setup can also accurately track the joint angle even when the joint axis is parallel to gravity and the accelerometer data does not provide useful information. In order to analyze this strategy, accelerometers and gyroscopes were mounted on one arm of a PR2 robot. The arm was manually moved smoothly through different trajectories in its workspace while the joint angle readings from the on-board optical encoders were compared against the joint angle estimates from the accelerometers and gyroscopes. The low cost angle estimation strategy has a mean error 1.3° over the three joints estimated, resulting in mean end effector position errors of 6.1 mm or less. This system provides an effective angular measurement as an alternative to high precision encoders in low cost manipulators and as redundant measurements for safety in other manipulators.</td>

These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.</td>

A majority of researchers working on robot grasping and object manipulation tend to utilize commercially available robot-manipulators equipped with various end effectors for experimental studies. However, commercially available robotic grippers are often expensive and are not easy to modify for specific purposes. To extend the choice of robotic end effectors freely available to researchers and educators, we present an open-source low-cost three-finger robotic gripper platform for research and educational purposes. The 3-D design model of the gripper is presented and manufactured with a minimal number of 3-D-printed components and an off-the-shelf servo actuator. An underactuated finger and gear train mechanism, with an overall gripper assembly design, are described in detail, followed by illustrations and a discussion of the gripper grasping performance and possible gripper platform modifications. The presented open-source gripper platform computer-aided design model is released for downloading on the authors research lab website (<;uri xlink:href="http://www.alaris.kz" xlink:type="simple">www.alaris.kz<;/uri>) and can be utilized by robotics researchers and educators as a design platform to build their own robotic end effector solutions for research and educational purposes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As robots and humans move towards sharing the same environment, the need for safety in robotic systems is of growing importance. Towards this goal of human-friendly robotics, a robust, low-cost, low-noise capacitive force sensing array is presented with application as a whole body artificial skin covering. This highly scalable design provides excellent noise immunity, low-hysteresis, and has the potential to be made flexible and formable. Noise immunity is accomplished through the use of shielding and local sensor processing. A small and low-cost multivibrator circuit is replicated locally at each taxel, minimizing stray capacitance and noise coupling. Each circuit has a digital pulse train output, which allows robust signal transmission in noisy electrical environments. Wire count is minimized through serial or row-column addressing schemes, and the use of an open-drain output on each taxel allows hundreds of sensors to require only a single output wire. With a small set of interface wires, large arrays can be scanned hundreds of times per second and dynamic response remains flat over a broad frequency range. Sensor performance is evaluated on a bench-top version of a 4 × 4 taxel array in quasi-static and dynamic cases.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new vision-based obstacle detection method for mobile robots. Each individual image pixel is classified as belonging either to an obstacle or the ground based on its color appearance. The method uses a single passive color camera, performs in real-time, and provides a binary obstacle image at high resolution. The system is easily trained by simply driving the robot through its environment. In the adaptive mode, the system keeps learning the appearance of the ground during operation. The system has been tested successfully in a variety of environments, indoors as well as outdoors.</td>

Extensive use is made of plastic castings, laser cut plastic sheets, and low-cost motors and electronic components. Modules interface with a host PC via Bluetooth® radio. An off-board camera, along with a set of modules and a control PC form a convenient, low-cost system for rapidly developing and testing control algorithms for modular reconfigurable robots.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper concerns the development of robot skin capable of accurately sensing the location of objects in area contact with the skin surface. There has been no report on tactile sensing which attained not only skin deformation detection but also contact object location sensing with high accuracy. In the category of optomechatronics technology, we apply optical fibers to transmit surface deformation information of soft skin for sensing the location of an object in contact with the soft skin accurately. In the paper, we illustrate the structure of the robot skin, and describe the principle of both detecting the position of the reflector chips and sensing the contact location of an object. The robot skin is characterized by the fact that the surface is low cost and easily replacable, and the sensing performance is robust against any electromagnetic disturbance. We then show experimental results for verifying the principles using a wedge-shaped object. For evaluating the sensing accuracy, comparisons are made: 1) between the location of a real convex of the object and that of the corresponding estimated polygon and 2) for the position of two vertices of the object when independent fitting and Lagrangian fitting methods are applied.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: It is often important to obtain the real-time location of a small-sized ground robotic vehicle when it performs autonomous tasks either indoors or outdoors. We propose and implement LOBOT, a low-cost, self-contained localization system for small-sized ground robotic vehicles. LOBOT provides accurate real-time, 3D positions in both indoor and outdoor environments. Unlike other localization schemes, LOBOT does not require external reference facilities, expensive hardware, careful tuning or strict calibration, and is capable of operating under various indoor and outdoor environments. LOBOT identifies the local relative movement through a set of integrated inexpensive sensors and well corrects the localization drift by infrequent GPS-augmentation. Our empirical experiments in various temporal and spatial scales show that LOBOT keeps the positioning error well under an accepted threshold.</td>
