i have my reasnos why i love making Business my career :
Business and related subjects (such as the ‘FAME’ group – finance, accounting, management and economics) are among
the most popular fields of study at universities worldwide, particularly at graduate level. You might have some vague
ideas about why this is the case – business graduates are in high demand worldwide, business touches on pretty much every
aspect of modern human society, careers with a business degree are diverse and often highly paid – and these assumptions are
likely to be largely true.
