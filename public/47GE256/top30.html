	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: abstract Being able to navigate accurately is one of the fundamental capabilities of a mobile robot to effectively execute a variety of tasks including docking, transportation, and manipulation. As real-world environments often contain changing or ambiguous areas, existing features can be insufficient for mobile robots to establish a robust navigation behavior. A popular approach to overcome this problem and to achieve accurate localization is to use artificial landmarks. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally placing such artificial landmarks for mobile robots that repeatedly have to carry out certain navigation tasks. Our method aims at finding the minimum number of landmarks for which a bound on the maximum deviation of the robot from its desired trajectory can be guaranteed with high confidence. The proposed approach incrementally places landmarks utilizing linearized versions of the system dynamics of the robot, thus allowing for an efficient computation of the deviation guarantee. We evaluate our approach in extensive experiments carried out both in simulations and with real robots. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches and is suitable for long-term operation of mobile robots.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mobile robot vision-based navigation has been the source of countless research contributions, from the domains of both vision and control. Vision is becoming more and more common in applications such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation, path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection. This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept of visual sonar has also been revised.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract— We propose a method for evaluating the localiza- tion accuracy of an indoor navigation system in arbitrarily large environments. Instead of using externally mounted sensors, as required by most ground-truth systems, our approach involves mounting only landmarks consisting of distinct patterns printed on inexpensive foam boards. A pose estimation algorithm computes the pose of the robot with respect to the land- mark using the image obtained by an on-board camera. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of providing accurate estimates of a mobile robot’s position and orientation with respect to the landmarks in arbitrarily-sized environments over arbitrarily-long trials. Furthermore, because the approach involves minimal outfitting of the environment, we show that only a small amount of setup time is needed to apply the method to a new environment. Experiments involving a state-of-the-art navigation system demonstrate the ability of the method to facilitate accurate localization measurements over arbitrarily long periods of time.</td>

In our case, an image-feature-based monocular vision technique determines only the heading of the vehicle while the vehicle's odometry is used to estimate the distance traveled. We present a mathematical proof and experimental evidence indicating that the localization error of a robot guided by this principle is bound. The experiments demonstrate that the method can cope with variable illumination, lighting deficiency and both short- and long-term environment changes. This makes the method especially suitable for deployment in scenarios which require long-term autonomous operation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract—Visual place recognition is a challenging problem due to the vast range of ways in which the appearance of real-world places can vary. In recent years, improvements in visual sensing capabilities, an ever-increasing focus on long-term mobile robot au- tonomy, and the ability to draw on state-of-the-art research in other disciplines—particularly recognition in computer vision and ani- mal navigation in neuroscience—have all contributed to significant advances in visual place recognition systems. This paper presents a survey of the visual place recognition research landscape. We start by introducing the concepts behind place recognition—the role of place recognition in the animal kingdom, how a “place” is defined in a robotics context, and the major components of a place recognition system. Long-term robot operations have revealed that changing appearance can be a significant factor in visual place recognition failure; therefore, we discuss how place recognition solutions can implicitly or explicitly account for appearance change within the environment. Finally, we close with a discussion on the future of visual place recognition, in particular with respect to the rapid ad- vances being made in the related fields of deep learning, semantic scene understanding, and video description.</td>

The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: The challenge of persistent appearance-based navigation and mapping is to develop an autonomous robotic vision system that can simultaneously localize, map and navigate over the lifetime of the robot. However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods typically scale not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform; also, repeated revisits to locations will develop multiple competing representations which reduce recall performance. In this paper we present a solution to the persistent localization, mapping and global path planning problem in the context of a delivery robot in an office environment over a one-week period. Using a graphical appearance-based SLAM algorithm, CAT-Graph, we demonstrate constant time and memory loop closure detection with minimal degradation during repeated revisits to locations, along with topological path planning that improves over time without using a global metric representation. We compare the localization performance of CAT-Graph to openFABMAP, an appearance-only SLAM algorithm, and the path planning performance to occupancy-grid based metric SLAM. We discuss the limitations of the algorithm with regard to environment change over time and illustrate how the topological graph representation can be coupled with local movement behaviors for persistent autonomous robot navigation.</td>

This topic continues to be an active area of research, and we highlight some directions in which available approaches may be improved. The chapter discusses models of the sensors and vehicle kinematics, as well as assumptions about the environment and performance criteria. Methods applicable to stationary obstacles, moving obstacles, and scenarios with multiple vehicles are covered. In preference to global approaches based on full knowledge of the environment, particular attention is given to reactive methods based on only local sensory data, with a special focus on recently proposed navigation laws based on the sliding mode and model predictive control.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an alternative approach to the problem of outdoor, persistent visual localisation against a known map. Instead of blindly applying a feature detector/descriptor combination over all images of all places, we leverage prior experiences of a place to learn place-dependent feature detectors (i.e., features that are unique to each place in our map and used for localisation). Furthermore, as these features do not represent low-level structure, like edges or corners, but are in fact mid-level patches representing distinctive visual elements (e.g., windows, buildings, or silhouettes), we are able to localise across extreme appearance changes. Note that there is no requirement that the features posses semantic meaning, only that they are optimal for the task of localisation. This work is an extension on previous work (McManus et al. in Proceedings of robotics science and systems, 2014b) in the following ways: (i) we have included a landmark refinement and outlier rejection step during the learning phase, (ii) we have implemented an asynchronous pipeline design, (iii) we have tested on data collected in an urban environment, and (iv) we have implemented a purely monocular system. Using over 100 km worth of data for training, we present localisation results from Begbroke Science Park and central Oxford.</td>

Concerning path-planning, it distinguishes continuous from discretized spaces and describes procedures applicable when the execution of a plan fails. It insists on the need for an integrated conception of such procedures, which must be tightly tailored to the specific robot that is used, notably to the capacities and limitations of its sensory-motor equipment, and to the specific environment that is experienced. A hierarchy of navigation strategies is outlined in the discussion, together with the sort of adaptive capacities each affords to cope with unexpected obstacles or dangers encountered on an animat or robot’s way to its goal. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract This paper presents a novel reactive collision avoidance method for mobile robots moving in dense and cluttered environments. The proposed method, entitled Tangential Gap flow (TGF), simplifies the navigation problem using a divide and conquer strategy inspired by the well-known Nearness-Diagram Navigation (ND) techniques. At each control cycle, the TGF extracts free openings surrounding the robot and identifies the suitable heading which makes the best progress towards the goal. This heading is then adjusted to avoid the risk of collision with nearby obstacles based on two concepts namely, tangential and gap flow navigation. The tangential navigation steers the robot parallel to the boundary of the closest obstacle while still emphasizing the progress towards the goal. The gap flow navigation safely and smoothly drives the robot towards the free area in between obstacles that lead to the target. The resultant trajectory is faster, shorter and less-oscillatory when compared to the ND methods. Furthermore, identifying the avoidance maneuver is extended to consider all nearby obstacle points and generate an avoidance rule applicable for all obstacle configurations. Consequently, a smoother yet much more stable behavior is achieved. The stability of the motion controller, that guides the robot towards the desired goal, is proved in the Lyapunov sense. Experimental results including a performance evaluation in very dense and complex environments demonstrate the power of the proposed approach. Additionally, a discussion and comparison with existing Nearness-Diagram Navigation variants is presented.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: Multi-Robot system became an important research area in the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. In the presence of obstacles, uncertainty and incomplete information Multi-Robot system is used to accomplish the task in more efficient way as compared to single robot system. Navigation of robots in its surrounding is essential to avoid unacceptable situation such as avoiding obstacles, trajectory planning. Cooperative behavior of multi-robots provides efficient way to avoid collision. It is a matter of concern that how a group of mobile robots should be controlled so that they can move in a cohesive way toward a single direction. For the problem of cooperation among robots, flocking strategy is a good solution. To learn cooperation among robots, various machine learning strategies have been developed. One of the machine learning techniques is called reinforcement learning. It is a very challenging issue in the area of robotics and artificial intelligence. Combining cooperative and learning strategy collision avoidance can be improved. Survey of multi-agent reinforcement learning and flocking control is presented in this paper.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract— Frequently, robots find themselves asking this question. Knowing your location?? And being able to navigate to other locations is extremely important for autonomous robots. The act of finding one's location against a map is known as localization. So how can a robot localize itself? The most common form of intelligent localization and navigation is to use a map, combined with sensor readings and some form of closed-loop motion feedback. But a robot needs to do so much more than just localizing itself. Often, we’d like our robots to be able to build their own maps, since map building by hand is tedious, boring, and error-prone. The field of robotics that studies localization and mapping is typically called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) [1]. Robot cists around the globe have been working to find a solution to localization for more than 20 years; however, only in the past 4-5 years we have seen some promising results. In this work, we describe a first-of-a-kind, breakthrough technology for pose finding for localization that requires only one low-cost camera and a powerful ARM based micro-controller. Because of its low-cost and robust performance in realistic environments, this technology is particularly well-suited for use in consumer and commercial applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Designing intelligent and robust autonomous navigation systems remains a great challenge in mobile robotics. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers an efficient learning technique from expert demonstrations to teach robots how to perform specific tasks without manually specifying the reward function. Most of existing IRL algorithms assume the expert policy to be optimal and deterministic, and are applied to experiments with relatively small-size state spaces. However, in autonomous navigation tasks, the state spaces are frequently large and demonstrations can hardly visit all the states. Meanwhile the expert policy may be non-optimal and stochastic. In this paper, we focus on IRL with large-scale and high-dimensional state spaces by introducing the neural network to generalize the expert’s behaviors to unvisited regions of the state space and an explicit policy representation is easily expressed by neural network, even for the stochastic expert policy. An efficient and convenient algorithm, Neural Inverse Reinforcement Learning (NIRL), is proposed. Experimental results on simulated autonomous navigation tasks show that a mobile robot using our approach can successfully navigate to the target position without colliding with unpredicted obstacles, largely reduce the learning time, and has a good generalization performance on undemonstrated states. Hence prove the robot intelligence of autonomous navigation transplanted from limited demonstrations to completely unknown tasks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract. Nowadays, mobile robots have attracted more and more at- tention from researchers due to their extensive applications. Mobile robots need to have the capabilities of autonomy and intelligence, and they pose a challenge to researchers, which is to design algorithms that allow the robots to function autonomously in unstructured, dynamic, partially observable, and uncertain environments [1]. Navigation is the key to the relative technologies of mobile robots and neural networks are widely used in the field of mobile robot navigation due to their prop- erties such as nonlinear mapping, ability to learn from examples, good generalization performance, massively parallel processing, and capability to approximate an arbitrary function given sufficient number of neurons. This paper surveys the developments in the last few years of the neural networks with applications to mobile robot navigation.</td>
