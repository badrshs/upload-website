Phillip Jack "Phil" Brooks[1] (born October 26, 1978), better known by the ring name CM Punk, is an American mixed martial artist (0–0 record), comic book writer, actor and retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his time in WWE, where he was the longest-reigning WWE Champion of the modern era, having held the title for 434 days from November 20, 2011 to January 27, 2013. His reign is officially recognized as the sixth longest of all time, as well as the longest since 1988.[5][6]
Punk won multiple world championships during his 15-year wrestling career: including the ROH World Championship and ECW Championship once each, WWE's World Heavyweight Championship three times, and the WWE Championship twice. He won the World Tag Team Championship (with Kofi Kingston) and the Intercontinental Championship, making him the 19th WWE Triple Crown Champion and the fastest man in WWE history to achieve this feat, in 203 days.[7] He was a two-time ROH Tag Team Champion (with Colt Cabana as part of The Second City Saints). Punk also won the 2008 and 2009 Money in the Bank ladder matches (the only wrestler to win the match twice),[8] and the 2011 Superstar of the Year Slammy Award in WWE
