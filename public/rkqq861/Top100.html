	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The field of autonomous mobile robotics has recently gained many researchers' interests. Due to the specific needs required by various applications of mobile robot systems, especially in navigation, designing a real time obstacle avoidance and path following robot system has become the backbone of controlling robots in unknown environments. Therefore, an efficient collision avoidance and path following methodology is needed to develop an intelligent and effective autonomous mobile robot system. This paper introduces a new technique for line following and collision avoidance in the mobile robotic systems. The proposed technique relies on the use of low-cost infrared sensors, and involves a reasonable level of calculations, so that it can be easily used in real-time control applications. The simulation setup is implemented on multiple scenarios to show the ability of the robot to follow a path, detect obstacles, and navigate around them to avoid collision. It also shows that the robot has been successfully following very congested curves and has avoided any obstacle that emerged on its path. Webots simulator was used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The paper discusses mobile robot localization by means of geometric features from a laser range finder and a CCD camera. The features are line segments from the laser scanner and vertical edges from the camera. Emphasis is put on sensor models with a strong physical basis. For both sensors, uncertainties in the calibration and measurement process are adequately modeled and propagated through the feature extractors. This yields observations with their first order covariance estimates which are passed to an extended Kalman filter for fusion and position estimation. Experiments on a real platform show that, opposed to the use of the laser range finder only, the multisensor setup allows the uncertainty to stay bounded in difficult localization situations like long corridors, and contributes to an important reduction of uncertainty, particularly in the orientation. The experiments further demonstrate the applicability of such a multisensor localization system in real time on a fully autonomous robot</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robotic swarms that take inspiration from nature are becoming a fascinating topic for multi-robot researchers. The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost, open-platform, autonomous micro-robot (Colias) for robotic swarm applications. Colias employs a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. It has a maximum speed of 35 cm/s which enables it to be used in swarm scenarios very quickly over large arenas. Long-range infrared modules with an adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours at a range of 0.5 cm to 2 m. Colias has been designed as a complete platform with supporting software development tools for robotics education and research. It has been tested in both individual and swarm scenarios, and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility for use as a micro-sized mobile robot and as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.</td>

Infrared is used for transmitting and receiving data packets and obstacle detection. The infrared communication system is used for an autonomous mobile robot (UPM-AMR) that will be used as a low-cost platform for robotics research. A pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital scheme is used for transmitting data. The reflected infrared signal is also used for distance estimation for obstacle avoidance. Analysis of robotpsilas behaviors shows the feasibility of using infrared signals to obtain a reliable local communication between swarm mobile robots.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes an algorithm for determining robot location from visual landmarks. This algorithm determines both the correspondence between observed landmarks (in this case vertical edges in the environment) and a stored map, and computes the location of the robot using those correspondences. The primary advantages of this algorithm are its use of a single geometric tolerance to describe observation error, its ability to recognize ambiguous sets of correspondences, its ability to compute bounds on the error in localization, and fast execution. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on a mobile robot system. In several hundred trials it has never failed, and computes location accurate to within a centimeter in less than 0.5 s</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The amplitude response of infrared (IR) sensors based on reflected amplitude of the surrounding objects is non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. As a result, the main use of IR sensors in robotics is for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, their inherently fast response is very attractive for enhancing the real-time operation of a mobile robot in, for instance, map building tasks. Thus, it seems that the development of new low-cost IR sensors able to accurately measure distances with reduced response times is worth researching. In this paper, a new IR sensor based on the light intensity back-scattered from objects and able to measure distances of up to 1 m is described. Also, the sensor model is described and the expected errors in distance estimates are analysed and modelled. Finally, the experimental results obtained are discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A new real-time obstacle avoidance approach for mobile robots has been developed and implemented. This approach permits the detection of unknown obstacles simultaneously with the steering of the mobile robot to avoid collisions and advancing toward the target. The novelty of this approach, entitled the Virtual Force Field, lies in the integration of two known concepts: Certainty Grids for obstacle representation, and Potential Fields for navigation. This combination is especially suitable for the accommodation of inaccurate sensor data (such as produced by ultrasonic sensors) as well as for sensor fusion, and enables continuous motion of the robot without stopping in front of obstacles. This navigation algorithm also takes into account the dynamic behavior of a fast mobile robot and solves the "local minimum trap " problem. Experimental results from a mobile robot running at a maximum speed of 0.78 m/sec demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm.</td>

The objective of the trajectory-generation algorithm is to optimise a cost function out to a limited time horizon. The space of control trajectories is searched by expanding a tree using randomised sampling, in a manner similar to an RRT. The algorithm is improved by seeding the tree using the best control trajectory from the previous iteration, and by pruning branches based on a bound to the cost function and the best trajectory found so far. Performance of the algorithm is analysed in simulation. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented on two kinds of vehicles: the Segway RMP and a four-wheel-drive. The algorithm has been used to drive autonomously for a combined total on the order of hundreds of hours.</td>

Layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mobile robots often must find a trajectory to another position in their environment, subject to constraints. This is the problem of planning a path through a continuous domain Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are a recently developed representation on which fast continuous domain path planners can be based. In this work, we build a path planning system based on RRTs that interleaves planning and execution, first evaluating it in simulation and then applying it to physical robots. Our planning algorithm, ERRT (execution extended RRT), introduces two novel extensions of previous RRT work, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve replanning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT is successfully applied to a real-time multi-robot system. Results demonstrate that ERRT is significantly more efficient for replanning than a basic RRT planner, performing competitively with or better than existing heuristic and reactive real-time path planning approaches. ERRT is a significant step forward with the potential for making path planning common on real robots, even in challenging continuous, highly dynamic domains.</td>

In order to efficiently perform useful tasks such as office delivery, mobile robots must know their position in their environment. Existing approaches can be distinguished according to the type of localization problem they are designed to solve. Tracking techniques aim at monitoring the robot's position. They assume that the position is initially known and cannot recover from situations in which they lost track of the robot's position. Global localization techniques on the other hand, are able to estimate the robot's position under complete uncertainty. We present the dynamic Markov localization technique as a uniform approach to position estimation, which is able (1) to globally estimate the position of the robot, (2) to efficiently track its position whenever the robot's certainty is high, and (3) to detect and recover from localization failures. The approach has been implemented and intensively tested in real-world environments. We present several experiments illustrating the strength of our method</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a proof-of-concept design for a low cost two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm that incorporates series elastic actuators (SEAs) with force sensing. The cost effective ness of the design will enable the construction of compliant manipulators for multi-robot systems with large populations. The arm assembly attaches to a commercially available mobile robot chassis to perform multi-robot coordination. In this work, we present the design of a robot arm and data from experiments to characterize the accuracy and resolution of the force sensing. We describe a force-following manipulation experiment using two robots. The experiment measures strain on a rigid bar between two robots. The data shows the feasibility of using SEAs for force sensing to reduce the strain in the bar. This is the first step towards a distributed force controller for multi robot object coordination with large numbers of robots.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Hyper-redundant manipulators can be fragile, expensive, and limited in their flexibility due to the distributed and bulky actuators that are typically used to achieve the precision and degrees of freedom (DOFs) required. Here, a manipulator is proposed that is robust, high-force, low-cost, and highly articulated without employing traditional actuators mounted at the manipulator joints. Rather, local tunable stiffness is coupled with off-board spooler motors and tension cables to achieve complex manipulator configurations. Tunable stiffness is achieved by reversible jamming of granular media, which-by applying a vacuum to enclosed grains-causes the grains to transition between solid-like states and liquid-like ones. Experimental studies were conducted to identify grains with high strength-to-weight performance. A prototype of the manipulator is presented with performance analysis, with emphasis on speed, strength, and articulation. This novel design for a manipulator-and use of jamming for robotic applications in general-could greatly benefit applications such as human-safe robotics and systems in which robots need to exhibit high flexibility to conform to their environments.</td>

It does not require camera calibration and works on semi-structured outdoor paths. The core of the method is based on segmenting images and classifying each super-pixel to infer a contour of navigable space. This method allows a mobile robot equipped with a monocular camera to follow different naturally delimited paths. The contour shape can be used to calculate the forward and steering speed of the robot. To achieve real-time computation necessary for on-board execution in mobile robots, the image segmentation is implemented on a low-power embedded GPU. The validity of our approach has been verified with an image dataset of various outdoor paths as well as with a real mobile robot.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The continuing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a rapidly growing demand for mobile robots to be used during Explosive Ordnance Disposal operations. These robots are predominately used by EOD technicians for surveillance and neutralization of explosive threats from a safe standoff distance. The hazardous nature of the mission these vehicles help perform requires them to be expendable. Current commercially available systems, however, although capable of performing the mission, are costly and are not currently available in the large quantities needed by EOD technicians. The Naval EOD Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) proposes an alternative; a low cost, mobile robot using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts that is specifically tailored to perform hazardous EOD missions. The main functions of this robot are efficient surveillance and explosive threat neutralization. The use of COTS parts allows for streamlined field supportability and repair. A proposed speed of five miles per hour is a drastic improvement over many existing EOD robots and will allow EOD teams to quickly survey and assess potentially dangerous situations. The manipulator will be capable of precision placement of neutralization charges. The cost of this proposed robot is $10,000. Current commercial robots capable of performing these EOD tasks range in price from $40,000 to over $150,000. This conference paper will describe the robot design and prototyping process, from gathering requirements to fabrication and testing.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a framework for cooperative control of a group of nonholonomic mobile robots that allows us to build complex systems from simple controllers and estimators. The resultant modular approach is attractive because of the potential for reusability. Our approach to composition also guarantees stability and convergence in a wide range of tasks. There are two key features in our approach: 1) a paradigm for switching between simple decentralized controllers that allows for changes in formation; 2) the use of information from a single type of sensor, an omnidirectional camera, for all our controllers. We describe estimators that abstract the sensory information at different levels, enabling both decentralized and centralized cooperative control. Our results include numerical simulations and experiments using a testbed consisting of three nonholonomic robots.</td>

Our system is based on the use of two sensors: an odometer and an omnidirectional vision system which gives a reference in connection with a set of natural beacons. Our navigation algorithm gives a reliable position estimation due to a systematic dynamic resetting. To merge the data obtained we use the extended Kalman filter. Our proposed method allows us to treat efficiently the noise problems linked to the primitive extraction, which contributes to the robustness of our system. Thus, we have developed a reliable and quick navigation system which can deals with the constraints of moving the robots in an industrial environment.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification of the environment to function properly, and those that work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization. In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method based on the CONDENSATION algorithm, a Bayesian filtering method that uses a sampling-based density representation. We show how the CONDENSATION algorithm can be rued in a novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the environment. Based on these two observations, we present a vision-based robot localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the viability of our approach, we show both global localization and tracking results in the context of a state of the art robotics application</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new method for improving the accuracy of inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on land vehicles. The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Navigating autonomously in obstacle-cluttered environment is an important problem for biped robots. Path planning using classical methods, such as A* search and Dijkstra's algorithm, has made a good progress. However, these methods are inefficient. In this paper, a new algorithm named Heuristic Bi-directional Discrete Rapidly-explore Random Trees (HBD-RRTs) is presented. According to discrete stance model, two randomized-sampling-based planning trees from start state and target state are constructed respectively, where the path is generated as a set of stances by bi-directional search. Then a series of off-line gaits and an online gait generator are used to transform the path to motion trajectory. The simulation result in the platform of ZJU-Dance humanoid robot demonstrated that HBD-RRTs for biped robots is less-time-consuming and makes real-time planning possible.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Providing contact sensing on the whole body of a robot is a key feature to increase the safety level of physical human-robot interaction. In this paper, a new robot skin capable of sensing multiple contact locations is presented. The motivation behind the proposed design is to produce a relatively inexpensive skin having the capability to provide the spatial location of collisions and also to add compliance to the robot's external cover. The resulting device is a thin flexible sensor sheet made of polyimide films with electrically conductive ink and a pressure sensitive conductive rubber sheet. The problem of internal wire routing is circumvented by the use of conductive ink and a circuit is proposed to minimize the number of output wires. To provide collision absorption and mechanical robustness, the sensor is embedded in different layers of polyurethane using shape deposition manufacturing (SDM). The paper presents the design and the fabrication process of the skin but also some experimental results on the determination of the mechanical properties of the resulting sensor as well as its potential for increasing human safety during human robot interaction.</td>

However, the sheer size of these unstructured environments (for example Australia's Great Barrier Reef) pose a number of challenges for current monitoring platforms which are typically remote operated and required significant resources and infrastructure. Therefore, a primary objective of the CSIRO robotic reef monitoring project is to develop and deploy a large number of AUV teams to perform broadscale reef surveying. In order to achieve this, the platforms must be cheap, even possibly disposable. This work presents the results of a preliminary investigation into the performance of a low-cost sensor suite and associated processing techniques for vision and inertial-based navigation within a highly unstructured reef environment.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization. Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization. A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For mobile robots to be successful, they have to navigate safely in populated and dynamic environments. While recent research has led to a variety of localization methods that can track robots well in static environments, we still lack methods that can robustly localize mobile robots in dynamic environ- ments, in which people block the robot’s sensors for extensive periods of time or the position of furniture may change. This paper proposes extensions to Markov localization algorithms enabling them to localize mobile robots even in densely pop- ulated environments. Two different filters for determining the “believability” of sensor readings are employed. These fil- ters are designed to detect sensor readings that are corrupted by humans or unexpected changes in the environment. The technique was recently implemented and applied as part of an installation, in which a mobile robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the “Deutsches Museum Bonn.” Extensive empiri- cal tests involving datasets recorded during peak traffic hours in the museum demonstrate that this approach is able to accu- rately estimate the robot’s position in more than 98% of the cases even in such highly dynamic environments.</td>

Unexploded ordnance (UXO) are commonplace in the developing world. Ideally, the handling of UXO would be carried out using EOD robots, like those employed by the US military. However, these devices are cost prohibitive for developing world governments and municipalities and, perhaps, not ideally suited for deployment by them. The low-cost EOD bot described in this paper, was conceived with the developing world in mind through a series of senior design projects and was designed to maintain functionality (e.g. ability to lift and drag heavy loads, place charges, etc.) while reducing cost. This is achieved through well thought out design tradeoffs and the use of lower-cost hardware. The general design of this robot, a discussion of design tradeoffs, and preliminary field tests are presented.</td>

The key idea is that each robot keeps a single friend at a desired angle θ, using some appropriate sensor. By panning the sensor by θ degrees, the goal for all formations becomes simply to center the friend in the sensor's field of view. We also present a general analytical measure for evaluating formations and apply it to the position data from both simulation and physical robot experiments.

In this paper we discuss some of the mechanical design challenges of developing a passive robotically-reconfigurable truss system, and present the concept of the factory floor, which can construct truss-like structures without climbing on them. In the proposed system, each level is constructed on a ground plane using a truss and node configuration and is elevated to make room for the next level. This process is repeated to create 3D truss structures or reversed to decompose the structure for the next task.</td>

Fine-grained localization can simplify multi-robot collaboration, enable energy efficient multi-hop routing for low-power radio networks, and enable automatic calibration of distributed sensing systems. We focus on range estimation, a critical prerequisite for fine-grained localization. While many mechanisms for range estimation exist, any individual mode of sensing can be blocked or confused by the environment. We present and analyze an acoustic ranging system that performs well in the presence of many types of interference, but can return incorrect measurements in non-line-of-sight conditions. We then suggest how evidence from an orthogonal sensory channel might be used to detect and eliminate these measurements. The work illustrates the more general research theme of combining multiple modalities to obtain robust results</td>

The paper describes a two-step process for correction of `systematic errors' in encoder measurements followed by fusion of the calibrated odometry with a gyroscope and GPS resulting in a robust localization scheme. A Kalman filter operating on data from the sensors is used for estimating position and orientation of the robot. Experimental results are presented that show an improvement of at least one order of magnitude in accuracy compared to the un-calibrated, un-filtered case. Our method is systematic, simple and yields very good results. We show that this strategy proves useful when the robot is using GPS to localize itself as well as when GPS becomes unavailable for some time. As a result robot can move in and out of enclosed spaces, such as buildings, while keeping track of its position on the fly</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, the role and importance of the machine vision systems in the industrial applications are described. First understanding of the vision in terms of a universal concept is explained. System design methodology is discussed and a generic machine vision model is reported. Such a machine includes systems and sub-systems, which of course depend on the type of applications and required tasks. In general, expected functions from a vision machine are the exploitation and imposition of the environmental constraint of a scene, the capturing of the images, analysis of those captured images, recognition of certain objects and features within each image, and the initiation of subsequent actions in order to accept or reject the corresponding objects. After a vision system performs all these stages, the task in hand is almost completed. Here, the sequence and proper functioning of each system and sub-systems in terms of high-quality images is explained. In operation, there is a scene with some constraint, first step for the machine is the image acquisition, pre-processing of image, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, inspection, and finally actuation, which is an interaction with the scene under study. At the end of this report, industrial image vision applications are explained in detail. Such applications include the area of automated visual inspection (AVI), process control, parts identification, and important role in the robotic guidance and control. Vision developments in manufacturing that can result in improvements in the reliability, in the product quality, and enabling technology for a new production process are presented. The key points in design and applications of a machine vision system are also presented. Such considerations can be generally classified into the six different categories such as the scene constraints, image acquisition, image pre-processing, image processing, machine vision justification, and finally the systematic considerations. Each aspect of such processes is described here and the proper condition for an optimal design is reported.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Knowledge of position in the context of its surrounding is necessary for robots to build maps and develop path plans. Limitations in odometry and the lack of a priori knowledge reduce the effectiveness of a single robot to retain a sense of position for any extended duration. The problem is only compounded when the scale of the robot is reduced. However, by employing multiple robots we can exploit their distributed nature to provide an external context in which to evaluate sensor readings for mapping and localization. We have designed a team of centimeter-sized robots that coordinate sensing and action to establish and maintain position as they move throughout space. By utilizing low-cost ultrasonic sensors, the team is able to measure the range between each robot pair. We pose these measurements in terms of a position likelihood and combine them to find a global solution that best maximizes the position likelihood of each robot. We also address a unique multipath interference mode that arises as a direct result of the reduced scale of the robot team. We present our experiences with localization and control of a small robot team</td>

In particular we study the problem of localizing RFID tags with a mobile platform that is equipped with a pair of RFID antennas. We present a probabilistic measurement model for RFID readers that allow us to accurately localize RFID tags in the environment. We also demonstrate how such maps can be used to localize a robot and persons in their environment. Finally, we present experiments illustrating that the computational requirements for global robot localization can be reduced strongly by fusing RFID information with laser data.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an efficient localization scheme for an indoors mobile robot using Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems. The mobile robot carries an RFID reader at the bottom of the chassis, which reads the RFID tags on the floor to localize the mobile robot. Each of the RFID tags stores its own absolute position, which is used to calculate the position, orientation, and velocity of the mobile robot. However, a localization system based on RFID technology inevitably suffers from an estimation error. In this paper, a new triangular pattern of arranging the RFID tags on the floor has been proposed to reduce the estimation error of the conventional square pattern. In addition, the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot has been utilized to improve the localization accuracy of the mobile robot. According to the conventional approach, two readers are necessary to identify the orientation of the mobile robot. Therefore, this new approach, based on the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot, provides a cheap and fast estimation of the orientation. The proposed algorithms used to raise the accuracy of the robot localization are successfully verified through experiments.</td>

Even in the low-cost SINS the gyroscopes have over 19 bits scales inputs. Conventional A/D converters only have 12~14 bits, can not meet the need. The oversampled A/D converter can reduce the quantization errors and improve the scales to fit for the low-cost SINS. The effect of oversampling was analyzed, not only in reducing quantization errors and signal noise, but also in improving integral filtering precision. The DPS+FPGA structure was used to collect the six signals of gyros and accelerometers in high speed and parallel mode. The experiment results show that, the low-cost SINS using the oversampled A/D converter have good performance in common integrate navigation applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a novel randomized motion planner for robots that must achieve a specified goal under kinematic and/or dynamic motion constraints while avoiding collision with moving obstacles with known trajectories. The planner encodes the motion constraints on the robot with a control system and samples the robot's state × time space by picking control inputs at random and integrating its equations of motion. The result is a probabilistic roadmap of sampled state ×time points, called milestones, connected by short admissible trajectories. The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning query, it generates a new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal state×time point. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the state×time space satisfies a geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly idealized version of our implemented planner is guaranteed to find a trajectory when one exists, with probability quickly converging to 1, as the number of milestones increases. Our planner was tested extensively not only in simulated environments, but also on a real robot. In the latter case, a vision module estimates obstacle motions just before planning starts. The planner is then allocated a small, fixed amount of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the expected motion of the obstacles is detected while the robot executes the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes a trajectory on the fly. Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the planner in order to deal with time delays and uncertainties that are inherent to an integrated robotic system interacting with the physical world.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Biped robots have better mobility than conventional wheeled robots, but they tend to tip over easily. To be able to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary for the robot to adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, and maintain its stability with a torso motion. When the ground conditions and stability constraint are satisfied, it is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. We first formulate the constraints of the foot motion parameters. By varying the values of the constraint parameters, we can produce different types of foot motion to adapt to ground conditions. We then propose a method for formulating the problem of the smooth hip motion with the largest stability margin using only two parameters, and derive the hip trajectory by iterative computation. Finally, the correlation between the actuator specifications and the walking patterns is described through simulation studies, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by simulation examples and experimental results</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For the guidance, control and navigation of autonomous vehicles, both positioning and orientation are important for mission success and surveillance. Global positioning system (GPS) and strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) have complementary characteristics to overcome the demerits of each other and can well perform as integrated navigation system. The observability analysis of low-cost SINS/GPS from many researches shown that the heading and yaw rate gyro bias is unobservable in straight motion and with constant acceleration. This paper presents integration of low-cost SINS/GPS aided with odometer and heading from two antennae GPS receiver to overcome this problem and to control the accuracy degradation during GPS outage. The carrier phase measurements are processed to obtain the heading from two antennae position measurement. The obtained heading and position from GPS and velocity measurement from odometer are used as observation input to extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the heading and positioning accuracy improvement of SINS/odometer/GPS integrated system for land vehicle navigation. When GPS signal is unavailable, the filter switches to SINS/odometer integration to control the position and velocity errors growth during this period. The observation model for heading measurement from two antennae is derived for the designed system. A field test was conducted to check the effectiveness using proposed method for heading and positioning accuracy improvement. The test results showed that Low-cost IMU/Odometer/ Two Antennae GPS integrated systems' accuracy both in position and heading is improved significantly.</td>

In particular, the goal was to realize: 1) soft; 2) robust; 3) small; and 4) low-cost sensors that can be easily fabricated and integrated on robotic devices that interact with the environment. We targeted a number of desired features, the most important being: 1) high sensitivity; 2) low hysteresis; and 3) repeatability. The sensor consists of a silicone body in which a small magnet is immersed; an Hall-effect sensor placed below the silicone body measures the magnetic field generated by the magnet, which changes when the magnet is displaced due to an applied external pressure. Two different versions of the sensor have been manufactured, characterized, and mounted on an anthropomorphic robotic hand. Experiments, in which the hand interacts with real-world objects, are reported.</td>

The major advantages of these methods are a wide field-of-view, capability of modeling cluttered environments, and flexibility in the learning phase. The redundant information captured in similar views is efficiently handled by the eigenspace approach. However, the standard approaches are sensitive to noise and occlusion. We present a method of view-based localization in a robust framework that solves these problems to a large degree.

We concentrate in this paper on analyzing the tradeoffs between maintaining dynamic roadmaps and applying an on-line bidirectional rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) planner alone, which requires no preprocessing or maintenance. We ground the analysis in several benchmarks in virtual environments with randomly moving obstacles. Different robotics structures are used, including a 17 degrees of freedom model of NASA's Robonaut humanoid. Our results show that dynamic roadmaps can be both faster and more capable for planning difficult motions than using on-line planning alone. In particular, we investigate its scalability to 3D workspaces and higher dimensional configurations spaces, as our main interest is the application of the method to interactive domains involving humanoids.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi-tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al-lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con-trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper-ational space&amp;mdash;the space in which the task is originally described&amp;mdash;rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine-matic transformation. Outside the obstacles ' regions of influ-ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap-proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma-nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con-straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The model-based vision system described in this paper allows a mobile robot to navigate indoors at an average speed of 8 to 10 m/min using ordinary laboratory computing hardware of approximately 16 MIPS power. The navigation capabilities of the robot are not impaired by the presence of stationary or moving obstacles. The vision system maintains a model of uncertainty and keeps track of the growth of uncertainty as the robot travels toward the goal position. The estimates of uncertainty are then used to predict bounds on the locations and orientations of landmarks expected to be seen in a monocular image. This greatly reduces the search for establishing correspondence between the features visible in the image and the landmarks. Given a sequence of image features and a sequence of landmarks derived from a geometric model of the environment, a special aspect of our vision system is the sequential reduction in the uncertainty as each image feature is matched successfully with a landmark, allowing subsequent features to be matched more easily; this is a natural by-product of the manner in which we use Kalman filter-based updating.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For complex robotic tasks (e.g., manipulation, locomotion), the lack of knowledge of precise interaction models, the difficulties to precisely measure the task associated physical quantities (e.g., position of contact points, interaction forces) in real-time, the finite sampling time of digital control loops and the non-collocation of sensors and transducers have negative effects on performance and stability of robots when using simple force or simple movement controllers. To cope with these issues, a new compact design for high performance actuators specifically adapted for integration in robotic mechanisms is presented. This design makes use of a mechanical differential as its central element. Results shown that differential coupling between an intrinsically high impedance transducer and an intrinsically low impedance mechanical spring provides the same benefits as serial coupling, but in a more compact and simple design. This new actuator, named Differential Elastic Actuator (DEA), provides interesting design implementations, especially for rotational actuators used for mobile robot locomotion.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstaclebased global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.</td>

The tilt sensor uses an internal pendulum and therefore has its own slow dynamics. These sensor dynamics were identified experimentally and combined to achieve high-bandwidth measurements using an optimal linear state estimator.

This prototype is designed to provide mobile robot swarms with advanced sensing capabilities in an efficient, cost-effective way. From the observation of bats' foraging behaviors, the prototype with a particular emphasis on variable rotation range and speed, as well as 360° observation capability has been developed. The prototype also aims at giving each robot reliable information about identification of neighboring robots from objects and their positions. For this purpose, an observation algorithm-based sensor is proposed. The implementation details are explained, and the effectiveness of the control schemes is verified through extensive experiments. The sensor provides real-time location of stationary targets positioned 100 cm away within an average error of 2.6 cm. Moreover, experimental results show that the prototype observation capability can be quite satisfactory for practical use of mobile robot swarms.</td>

This paper proposed an intrusion detection algorithm based on collecting light signal and a counter-based routing protocol integrated with Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). The counter-based routing protocol makes use of a randomized delay before a data transmission to reduce data redundancy. This provides a lightweight solution while preserving the advantage of being an easily implementable protocol. Furthermore, an event-based interface to facilitate handshaking between the new routing protocol and the proposed lightweight motion detection algorithm is defined to realize the intrusion detection application. The detection algorithm and the routing protocol are implemented in a prototypical wireless sensor network using MICA2 sensor motes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The paper presents a robust outdoor stereo vision simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. It estimates camera pose reliably in outdoor environments with directional sunlight illumination causing shadows and non-uniform scene lighting. The algorithm has been developed to measure a mining rope shovel's rotation angle about its vertical axis (``swing'' axis). A stereo camera is mounted externally to the shovel house (upper revolvable portion of the shovel), with a clear view of the shovel's lower carbody. As the shovel house swings, the camera revolves with the shovel house in a planar circular orbit, seeing differing views of the carbody top. During the swing, the SLAM algorithm builds a map of observed 3D features on the carbody and simultaneously using these landmarks to estimate the camera position. This estimated camera position is then used to compute the shovel swing angle. Two novel techniques are employed to improve the SLAM algorithm's robustness in outdoor environments. First, a ``Locally Maximal'' feature selection technique for Harris corners is used to select features more consistently in non-uniformly illuminated scenes. Another novel technique is the use of 3D ``Feature Clusters'' as SLAM landmarks rather than individual single features. The Feature Cluster landmarks improve the robustness of the landmark matching and allow significant reduction of the SLAM filter computational cost. This approach of estimating the shovel swing angle has a maximum error of textpm1textdegree upon SLAM map convergence. Results demonstrate the improvements of using the novel techniques compared to previous methods.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: With continuing developments in automation, robots will begin to supplement tasks that ordinary humans find dull, dirty or dangerous. In situations where robots and humans are interacting or working together, humanoid robots can better navigate human environments and make humans more comfortable with their appearance. Until recently, most humanoid robots were custom-made and designed for one specific environment. The development of open-source, low-cost humanoid robotics platforms, such as Trossen's HR-OS1, provide skeleton platforms that can be developed for mass use in environments with extensive human-robot interaction, such as retail settings. With this future in mind, the base HR-OS1 platform was modified with additional hardware and a new software framework to give it the navigation and communication skills required to be a personal attendant. This design can serve as a model for a humanoid robot in other settings where human-robot interaction is advantageous.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Location knowledge of nodes in a network is essential for many tasks such as routing, cooperative sensing, or service delivery in ad hoc, mobile, or sensor networks. This paper introduces a novel iterative method ILS for node localization starting with a relatively small number of anchor nodes in a large network. At each iteration, nodes are localized using a least-squares based algorithm. The computation is lightweight, fast, and any-time. To prevent error from propagating and accumulating during the iteration, the error control mechanism of the algorithm uses an error registry to select nodes that participate in the localization, based on their relative contribution to the localization accuracy. Simulation results have shown that the active selection strategy significantly mitigates the effect of error propagation. The algorithm has been tested on a network of Berkeley Mica2 motes with ultrasound TOA ranging devices. We have compared the algorithm with more global methods such as MDS-MAP and SDP-based algorithm both in simulation and on real hardware. The iterative localization achieves comparable location accuracy in both cases, compared to the more global methods, and has the advantage of being fully decentralized.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The most classical way of attempting to solve the vision-guided navigation problem for autonomous robots corresponds to the use of three-dimensional (3-D) geometrical descriptions of the scene; what is known as model-based approaches. However, these approaches do not facilitate the user's task because they require that geometrically precise models of the 3-D environment be given by the user. In this paper, we propose the use of “annotations” posted on some type of blackboard or “descriptive” map to facilitate this user-robot interaction. We show that, by using this technique, user commands can be as simple as “go to label 5.” To build such a mechanism, new approaches for vision-guided mobile robot navigation have to be found. We show that this can be achieved by using mixture models within an appearance-based paradigm. Mixture models are more useful in practice than other pattern recognition methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) or Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA)-also known as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), because they can represent nonlinear subspaces. However, given the fact that mixture models are usually learned using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which is a gradient ascent technique, the system cannot always converge to a desired final solution, due to the local maxima problem. To resolve this, a genetic version of the EM algorithm is used. We then show the capabilities of this latest approach on a navigation task that uses the above described “annotations.”</td>

This paper presents our preliminary work on the robot design and our experience using it to teach an introductory engineering class. The hardware can support classes in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The low-cost and small size will enable more research groups to perform multi-robot experiments on physical hardware.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-robot manipulation allows for scalable environmental interaction, which is critical for multi-robot systems to have an impact on our world. A successful manipulation model requires cost-effective robots, robust hardware, and proper system feedback and control. This paper details key sensing and manipulator capabilities of the r-one robot. The r-one robot is an advanced, open source, low-cost platform for multi-robot manipulation and sensing that meets all of these requirements. The parts cost is around $250 per robot. The r-one has a rich sensor suite, including a flexible IR communication/localization/obstacle detection system, high-precision quadrature encoders, gyroscope, accelerometer, integrated bump sensor, and light sensors. Two years of working with these robots inspired the development of an external manipulator that gives the robots the ability to interact with their environment. This paper presents an overview of the r-one, the r-one manipulator, and basic manipulation experiments to illustrate the efficacy our design. The advanced design, low cost, and small size can support university research with large populations of robots and multi-robot curriculum in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. We conclude with remarks on the future implementation of the manipulators and expected work to follow.</td>

It presents three innovations: It is a powerful, cheap, robust, and small advanced personal robot; it forms the foundation of a problem-based learning curriculum; and it enables a novel multi-robot curriculum while fostering collaborative team work on assignments. The robot design has many features specific to educators: It is advanced enough for academic research, has a broad feature set to support a wide range of curricula, and is inexpensive enough to be an effective outreach tool. The low cost allows each student to have their own robot for the semester, so they can work on activities outside the classroom. This robot was used in three different classes in which it was the foundation for an innovative problem-based learning curriculum. In particular, the robot has specialized sensors and a communications system that supports novel multi-robot curricula, which encourage student interaction in new ways. The results are promising; the robot was a big success in graduate, undergraduate, and outreach activities. Finally, student assessments indicate a greater interest and understanding of engineering and other STEM majors, and class evaluations were consistently above average.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Flexible automation systems provide the needed adaptability to serve shorter-term projects and specialty applications in biochemical analysis. A low-cost selective compliant articulated robotic arm designed for liquid spillage avoidance is developed here. In the vertical-plane robotic arm movement test, the signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and accelerometer were able to sense collisions. In the horizontal movement test, however, only the signals from the IMU enabled collision to be detected. Using a calculation method developed, it was possible to chart the regions where the obstacle was likely to be located when a collision occurred. The low cost of the IMU and its easy incorporation into the robotic arm offer the potential to meet the pressures of lowering operating costs, apply laboratory automation in resource-limited venues, and obviate human intervention in response to sudden disease outbreaks.</td>

Inclusion of robotic platforms on the de-mining process will help tasks like the recognizance and perception of dangerous areas, minimizing human risk. As a mobile robot, the modular snake robot can move in a uneven terrain similar to a mined scenario. That is why, the main research efforts have been done on locomotion. Several contributions on this area are reported including gaits like: closed chain rolling, lateral rolling and a gait that use a helix shape both on the outside of cylinders. Another gait studied regards the swing movement of a modular robot chain hanging from one of its end modules. Contributions on robot architecture are reported here, including a distributed model predictive control and a multi-camera and sensor fusion. The perception problem of these robots also are researched by our lab and a pair of developments are shown here.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we focus on configuring a low cost RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) system with less RFID readers and low density RFID tag textiles for stable and accurate self-localization for an omni-directional mobile robot. An RFID system using multiple RFID readers and high density RFID tags has already been applied to an indoor mobile robot self-localization. However, the system production cost is relatively high. To reduce the production cost of the system while maintaining the self-localization performance, we redesign two new RFID systems configured with 20 RFID readers and 5 RFID readers enlarging the size of an RFID reader antenna. Particularly, a new likelihood function of the tag detection with the redesigned large size RFID reader antenna is proposed for Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). Furthermore, we come up with a novel arrangement of RFID tags installed in a hexagon pattern. The new arrangement of ID tags enables both low cost ID tag installation and high performance of self-localization. We examine the performances of robot self-localization with less RFID readers and lower density RFID tags installed on the floor based on MCL(Monte Carlo localization). The simulation demonstrates the validity of our proposed configuration of the RFID based self-localization.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The ability to control compliance of robotic joints is desirable because the resulting robotic mechanisms can adapt to varying task requirements and can take advantage of natural limb and joint dynamics. The implementation of controllable compliance in ro- bots, however, is often constrained by the inherent instability of active compliance meth- ods and by the limited availability of the custom, nonlinear springs needed by passive compliance methods. This work overcomes a major limitation of passive compliance by producing designs for two novel mechanisms capable of generating a wide variety of specifiable, nonlinear elastic relationships. One of these designs is physically imple- mented as a quadratic “spring” and is used to create a passively compliant robot joint with series-elastic actuation. A simple feed-forward algorithm is then experimentally shown to be sufficient to control independently and simultaneously both joint angle and joint compliance, regardless of the presence of external forces on the joint. We believe that this is the first physically constructed system to use antagonistic quadratic springs to successfully demonstrate open-loop, independent, and simultaneous control of both joint angle and joint stiffness. Because this approach better emulates the underlying joint mechanics used by animals, it may improve both the quality and variety of robotic movements.</td>

First, we describe the design of a reactive navigation method that uses a "divide and conquer" strategy based on situations to simplify the difficulty of the navigation. Many techniques could be used to implement this design (since it is described at symbolic level), leading to new reactive methods that must be able to navigate in arduous environments (as the difficulty of the navigation is simplified). We also propose a geometry-based implementation of our design called the nearness diagram navigation. The advantage of this reactive method is to successfully move robots in troublesome scenarios, where other methods present a high degree of difficulty in navigating. We show experimental results on a real vehicle to validate this research, and a discussion about the advantages and limitations of this new approach.</td>

Given the fast growing technological progress in these fields, robots can offer a wide range of applications. However real world integration and application development for such a distributed system composed of many robotic modules and networked robotic devices is very difficult. Therefore, middleware services provide a novel approach offering many possibilities and drastically enhancing the application development for robots. This paper surveys the current state of middleware approaches in this domain. It discusses middleware challenges in these systems and presents some representative middleware solutions specifically designed for robots.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Instrumenting the physical world through large networks of wireless sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmen- tal monitoring of water and soil, requires that these nodes be very small, light, untethered and unobtrusive. The problem of localization, i.e., de- termining where a given node is physically located in a network is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applica- tions. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS (Global Positioning System) on all nodes in these networks. In this paper, we review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity-metric method for localization in outdoor environ- ments that makes use of the inherent radio-frequency (RF) communi- cations capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, that is more ro- bust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then depen- dent on the separation distance between two adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimen- tal results show that the accuracy for 90% of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.</td>

The hardware implementation of the proposed detection system uses two Sharp GP2D02 infra-red range sensors which are placed cross over each other in front of the robot in order to detect any object and avoid collisions. The software implementation of the proposed detection system is implemented using timer with the overflow interrupt for generating the required waveform for driving the Sharp GP2D02 infra-red range sensor. As a result, the mobile robot is able to execute different tasks without a delay on the processing time, for example driving the robot wheels and drive the Sharp sensors for detecting an object. Experimental results show that the proposed detection system successfully detect an object placed in a path of the mobile robot.</td>

The major advantage of LANDMARC is that it improves the overall accuracy of locating objects by utilizing the concept of reference tags. Based on experimental analysis, we demonstrate that active RFID is a viable and cost-effective candidate for indoor location sensing. Although RFID is not designed for indoor location sensing, we point out three major features that should be added to make RFID technologies competitive in this new and growing market.</td>

The skin is organized as a network of self-contained modules consisting of tiny pressure-sensitive elements which communicate through a serial bus. By adding or removing modules it is possible to adjust the area covered by the skin as well as the number (and density) of tactile elements. The skin is therefore highly modular and thus intrinsically scalable. Moreover, because the substrate on which the modules are mounted is sufficiently pliable to be folded and stiff enough to be cut, it is possible to freely distribute the individual tactile elements. A tactile skin composed of multiple modules can also be installed on curved surfaces. Due to their easy configurability we call our sensors "cut-and-paste tactile sensors."

We assume that the robot is able to identify IC tags and measure the robot's pose based on the relation between the previous and current location according to the IC tags. However, there arises the problem of uncertainty of location due to the nature of the antenna and IC tags. In other words, an error is always present which is relative to the sensing area of the antenna. Many researches have used external sensors in order to reduce the location errors, with few researches presented involving purely RFID driven systems. Our proposed algorithm that uses only passive RFID is able to estimate the robot's location and orientation more precisely by using trigonometric functions and the IC tags' Cartesian coordinates in a regular gridlike pattern. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively estimates both the location and the pose of a mobile robot during navigation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a distributed particle filter algorithm for localizing multiple mobile robots that are equipped only with low cost/low power sensors. This method is applicable to multi-micro robot systems, where size limitations restrict sensor selection (e.g. small infrared range finders). Localization of three robots in a known environment is conducted by combining measurements from a small number of simple range sensors with inter-robot distances obtained through an acoustic range finder system. The localization problem is formulated as estimating the global position and orientation of a single triangle, where corners of the triangle represent the positions of robots. The robot positions relative to the centroid of the triangle are then determined by trilateration using the inter-robot distance measurements. Each robot uses an identical particle filter algorithm to estimate the global position of the triangle. The best estimates determined by each particle filter are distributed among the robots for use in the following iteration. Simulations demonstrate the ability to perform global localization of three robots, each using a compass and two range finders. The results illustrate that this method can globally localize the robot team in a simulated indoor environment The results are compared to simulations where robots have access to only their own sensor data, which are unable to successfully localize under equivalent conditions.</td>

Although there are several commercial mobile robots available for these tasks, they are often costly, do not always meet the characteristics needed for certain applications and are very difficult to adapt because they have proprietary software and hardware. In this paper, we present the design principles, and describe the development and applications of a mobile robot called ExaBot. Our main goal was to obtain a single multi-purpose low-cost robot -more than ten times cheaper than commercially available platforms- that can be used not only for research, but also for education and public outreach activities. The body of the ExaBot, its sensors, actuators, processing units and control board are described in detail. The software and printed circuit board developed for this project are open source to allow the robotics community to use and upgrade the current version. Finally, different configurations of the ExaBot are presented, showing several applications that fulfill the requirements this robotic platform was designed for. ? 2014 Springer International Publishing.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The architecture of an indoor target localization system employing a small number of infrared-emitting diodes and sensors is presented in this paper. The properties of infrared light and magnetic fields have already been exploited for position localization in distances of several centimeters. Ultrasonic waves and laser light can be used for longer distance estimation if the system is capable of accurately measuring the time of flight of the reflected signals. The proposed approach intends to cover a distance of several meters without requiring high accuracy measurements and sensors of increased precision. The digital infrared patterns that are transmitted from a constant position are recognized by a pair of sensors mounted on the moving target, with varying success rate depending on the distance and the angular displacement from the transmitter. Processing the success rate instead of the analogue signal intensity requires low-cost digital microcontroller systems of moderate precision and computational power. Moreover, longer distances can be covered since attenuated, noisy, or scrambled patterns are also important for the position estimation in the proposed approach. A proper modeling of the pattern recognition success rate is presented in order to estimate distances of several meters with an adjustable estimation error. The use of multiple infrared pattern transmitting devices results in extension of the area covered and a reduction of the estimation error due to additional crosschecks that may be accomplished. The area covered can be increased by a factor between 20% and 100% depending on the allowed range overlapping of the transmitting devices. The potential topology of these devices is also discussed and analyzed. The presented system can be used in several virtual reality and robotics applications</td>

The proposed soft inflatable robot finger is different from traditional designs. It uses a common and low cost inflatable material and can be easily and massively manufactured. The proposed soft inflatable finger only weighs 0.8 grams, but can well realize swift movement which is actuated by low pressure air. Numerous analyses and experiments have been conducted for key parameters selection of the mechanical design. The performances of the proposed finger including flexing and extending have also been evaluated, and results are satisfactory.</td>

To ensure mechanical stability a centrifugal impeller is used and positioned above the robot that helps to generate an isolated low pressure area that makes adhesion to the vertical wall possible. When the impeller works, the sealing used in our robot reshapes to the shape of the contacting surface, maintaining the low pressure area inside which is a main advantage that eliminates the need for a perfect sealing as required by other vacuum powered wall climbing robots. To control the robot we use an ATmega8 micro controller along with RF wireless transceiver module and some discrete components. The experiment results verified the feasibility of the robot and it can make wall to floor and floor to wall transitions.</td>

Instead of using an absolute positioning approach with fixed beacons in the operating environment, we have developed a ultrasonic relative positioning system that allows each robot to perceive the distance and the angle of other nearby robots in relation to its own position. The system is based on time-of-flight evaluation of ultrasonic pulses and a RF communication link. The system has a precision of 8 mm and of 3deg over a 6.7 m range.

The system utilizes a low cost CMOS color camera module, a frame buffer chip and all image data is processed by a low cost microcontroller. The system includes the original functionality of color blob tracking, but improves upon it with tracking speeds of up to 50 frames per second. New functionality includes frame differencing, edge detection, and color histogramming.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Industrial applications often impose hard requirements on the precision of autonomous vehicle systems. As a consequence industrial Automatically Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems still use high-cost infrastructure based positioning solutions. In this paper we propose a map based localization method that fulfills the requirements on precision and repeatability, typical for industrial application scenarios. The proposed method - Normal Distributions Transform Monte Carlo Localization (NDT-MCL) is based on a well established probabilistic framework. In a novel contribution, we formulate the MCL localization approach using the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) as an underlying representation for both map and sensor data. By relaxing the hard discretization assumption imposed by grid-map models and utilizing the piece-wise continuous NDT representation the proposed algorithm achieves substantially improved accuracy and repeatability. The proposed NDT-MCL algorithm is evaluated using offline data sets from both a laboratory and a real-world industrial environments. Additionally, we report a comparison of the proposed algorithm to grid-based MCL and to a commercial localization system when used in a closed-loop with the control system of an AGV platform. In all tests the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to provide performance superior to that of standard grid-based MCL and comparable to the performance of the commercial infrastructure based positioning system.</td>

The robot has an automatic nerf gun mounted on the top of an all-terrain mobile platform. The sensors used for target tracking are low cost infrared proximity sensors. The robot can be set into an autonomous sentry mode, in which it can track targets and fire at them automatically, or a controlled mode, for driving the turret to a new location. This design uses much more cost effective and readily available hardware and materials, and also provides an improved tracking mechanism.</td>

This article presents a family of probabilistic localization algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). MCL algorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted hypotheses (samples), which approximate the posterior under a common Bayesian formulation of the localization problem. Building on the basic MCL algorithm, this article develops a more robust algorithm called Mixture-MCL, which integrates two complimentary ways of generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm to mobile robots equipped with range finders, a kernel density tree is learned that permits fast sampling. Systematic empirical results illustrate the robustness and computational efficiency of the approach. textcopyright 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As robots and humans move towards sharing the same environment, the need for safety in robotic systems is of growing importance. Towards this goal of human-friendly robotics, a robust, low-cost, low-noise capacitive force sensing array is presented with application as a whole body artificial skin covering. This highly scalable design provides excellent noise immunity, low-hysteresis, and has the potential to be made flexible and formable. Noise immunity is accomplished through the use of shielding and local sensor processing. A small and low-cost multivibrator circuit is replicated locally at each taxel, minimizing stray capacitance and noise coupling. Each circuit has a digital pulse train output, which allows robust signal transmission in noisy electrical environments. Wire count is minimized through serial or row-column addressing schemes, and the use of an open-drain output on each taxel allows hundreds of sensors to require only a single output wire. With a small set of interface wires, large arrays can be scanned hundreds of times per second and dynamic response remains flat over a broad frequency range. Sensor performance is evaluated on a bench-top version of a 4 × 4 taxel array in quasi-static and dynamic cases.</td>

Each individual image pixel is classified as belonging either to an obstacle or the ground based on its color appearance. The method uses a single passive color camera, performs in real-time, and provides a binary obstacle image at high resolution. The system is easily trained by simply driving the robot through its environment. In the adaptive mode, the system keeps learning the appearance of the ground during operation. The system has been tested successfully in a variety of environments, indoors as well as outdoors.</td>

System require- ments vary depending on the scope of the application; for example, an en- tertainment system does not need the gesture-recognition accuracy required of a surgical system. We divide these applications into four main classes—medical systems and assistive technologies; crisis man- agement and disaster relief; enter- tainment; and human-robot interac- tion—illustrating them through a set of examples. For each, we present the human factors and usability consider- ations needed to motivate use. Some techniques are simple, often lacking robustness in cluttered or dynamic scenarios, indicating the potential for further improvement. In each, the raw data is real-time video streams of hand gestures (vision-based), requiring ef- fective methods for capturing and processing images.

Researchers have begun to examine computers that would autonomously change their functionality based on observations of who or what was around them.

In this paper the typical problems of sonar based autonomous navigation and the authors' solutions to overcome them are discussed. The authors have created, robust modules for sonar data fusion and safe steering which significantly improve known methods. There are furthermore robot control behaviors which offer specific competence to solve high-level tasks. These behaviors build a hierarchical architecture but have the ability to assess their respective task and autonomously suggest a different, more competent behavior to continue. Thus, the behaviors work together as distributed competencies. The concept described here is being evaluated in a system on the authors' experimental robot ROAMER.

There has been no report on tactile sensing which attained not only skin deformation detection but also contact object location sensing with high accuracy. In the category of optomechatronics technology, we apply optical fibers to transmit surface deformation information of soft skin for sensing the location of an object in contact with the soft skin accurately. In the paper, we illustrate the structure of the robot skin, and describe the principle of both detecting the position of the reflector chips and sensing the contact location of an object. The robot skin is characterized by the fact that the surface is low cost and easily replacable, and the sensing performance is robust against any electromagnetic disturbance. We then show experimental results for verifying the principles using a wedge-shaped object. For evaluating the sensing accuracy, comparisons are made: 1) between the location of a real convex of the object and that of the corresponding estimated polygon and 2) for the position of two vertices of the object when independent fitting and Lagrangian fitting methods are applied.</td>

And for the micro electromechanical system (MEMS) technology based low-cost strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), over too large bias drift errors not only made the system functions nonlinear, but also made the estimation for misalignment angle converge to a false value. Therefore, this paper concerns the MEMS-based low-cost SINS initial alignment under the dynamic movement with large initial error. A nonlinear mathematics model of SINS initial alignment has been derived.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot fabrication has always been a costly matter. Even for educational purposes, one will need to spend substantial amount of money for building single robot with limited capabilities. When it comes to development of higher capabilities and intelligence, more investment will be required. In this paper, we present details of a mobile robot that is specially designed and made to be used as a stand-alone or in a swarm of robots. This robot can navigate outdoor autonomously based on a digital compass, GPS module and a transceiver module to communicate with other robots and a base station as research work in swarm robotics is mainly based on two way communication. Using the same onboard transceiver module, certain limited modifications to this robot would be needed for indoor navigation using wireless sensor networks.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: It is often important to obtain the real-time location of a small-sized ground robotic vehicle when it performs autonomous tasks either indoors or outdoors. We propose and implement LOBOT, a low-cost, self-contained localization system for small-sized ground robotic vehicles. LOBOT provides accurate real-time, 3D positions in both indoor and outdoor environments. Unlike other localization schemes, LOBOT does not require external reference facilities, expensive hardware, careful tuning or strict calibration, and is capable of operating under various indoor and outdoor environments. LOBOT identifies the local relative movement through a set of integrated inexpensive sensors and well corrects the localization drift by infrequent GPS-augmentation. Our empirical experiments in various temporal and spatial scales show that LOBOT keeps the positioning error well under an accepted threshold.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm has found widespread use in the field of robot motion planning because it provides a single-shot, probabilistically complete planning method which generalizes well to a variety of problem domains. We present the multipartite RRT (MP-RRT), an RRT variant which supports planning in unknown or dynamic environments. By purposefully biasing the sampling distribution and re-using branches from previous planning iterations, MP-RRT combines the strengths of existing adaptations of RRT for dynamic motion planning. Experimental results show MP-RRT to be very effective for planning in dynamic environments with unknown moving obstacles, replanning in high-dimensional configuration spaces, and replanning for systems with space time constraints.</td>
