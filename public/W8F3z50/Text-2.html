        Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest

        Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak
        <br> <br>
        
        <img src="imageslaila.jpg">
        
        <br> <br> <br> 
        
        so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood
        
        <br>

        as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.
        
        <br>
        That's a good idea," her mother said. So they packed a nice
        <br>
        basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.
        <br>
        When the basket was ready,the little girl put
        <br>
        on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.
