	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe a real-time, low-cost system to localize a mobile robot in outdoor environments. Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion in real time (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman filter to prevent long-term drifts. Experimental results are presented for outdoor localization in moderately sized environments (ges100 meters).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: An autonomous mobile robot must face the correspondence or data association problem in order to carry out tasks like place recognition or unknown environment mapping. In order to put into correspondence two maps, most correspondence methods first extract early features from robot sensor data, then matches between features are searched and finally the transformation that relates the maps is estimated from such matches. However, finding explicit matches between features is a challenging and computationally expensive task. In this paper, we propose a new method to align obstacle maps without searching explicit matches between features. The maps are obtained from a stereo pair. Then, we use a vocabulary tree approach to identify putative corresponding maps followed by a Newton minimization algorithm to find the transformation that relates both maps. The proposed method is evaluated on a typical office dataset showing good performance.</td>

For model-building, range data from ultrasonic sensors are constantly sampled and a map is built and updated immediately while the robot is travelling through the workspace. The local world model is based on the concept of an occupancy grid. The world model extracted from the range data is based on the geometric primitive of line segments. For the extraction of these features, methods such as the Hough transform and clustering are utilized. The perceived local world model along with dead-reckoning and ultrasonic sensor data are combined using an extended Kalman filter in a localization scheme to estimate the current position and orientation of the mobile robot, which is subsequently fed to the map-building algorithm. Implementation issues and experimental results with the Nomad 150 mobile robot in a real-world indoor environment (office space) are presented</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We consider the problem of automating the motion performed by a human operator when manipulating a specimen in tasks such as visual inspections for defects. This is a typical situation in which the trajectory of the manipulated object is hardly described by analytical functions, since the actual movements are suggested more by the operator's experience, rather than a standardized protocol. In principle, traditional motion capture systems based on computer vision methods could be employed to reconstruct the motion: however, especially when manipulating small specimens, visual occlusions caused by the operator's hand prevent the correct tracking of the moving object. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of reconstructing the motion by using the information provided by a low-cost MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached to the specimen. For simple manipulating tasks such as shaking and rotations, we show that the motion capture system based on inertial measurements can be effectively used.</td>

The inappropriate posture data are stored in an EEPROM. The software part of the system downloads, analyzes and presents the data in graphical format to enable a carer or therapist to quickly glance at the durations, frequency and locations of inappropriate postures.</td>

This algorithm determines both the correspondence between observed landmarks (in this case vertical edges in the environment) and a stored map, and computes the location of the robot using those correspondences. The primary advantages of this algorithm are its use of a single geometric tolerance to describe observation error, its ability to recognize ambiguous sets of correspondences, its ability to compute bounds on the error in localization, and fast execution. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on a mobile robot system. In several hundred trials it has never failed, and computes location accurate to within a centimeter in less than 0.5 s</td>

Differently from conventional development of robot hands, KITECH hand adopts a RC servo module that is cheap, easily obtainable, and easy to handle. The RC servo module that have been already used for several small sized humanoid can be new solution of building small sized robot hand with many joints. The feasibility of KITECH hand in object manipulation is shown through various experimental results.

Performance of the gyroscopes with error models is compared to the performance when the error models are excluded from the system. Similar error models have been developed for each axis of a solid-state triaxial accelerometer and for a conducting-bubble tilt sensor which may also be used as a low-cost accelerometer.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Building a truly reliable mobile robot system-one that can navigate without failures for long periods of time (weeks or months)-requires making clear assumptions bounding uncertainty and enforcing those assumptions by appropriately engineering the robot and its workspace. Weak assumptions may result in low-cost engineering but make the navigation problem intractable. On the other hand, strict assumptions may simplify navigation but reduce the flexibility of the resulting system. The work presented in this paper investigates the tradeoff between “computational complexity” and “physical complexity” and advocates landmarks as a way of managing this tradeoff. We first define a formal navigation problem which incorporates enough assumptions to make it computationally tractable. We then use landmarks to enforce those assumptions. By implementing this system on our mobile robot we show that the assumptions are enforceable, that the engineering costs of using landmarks are acceptable, and that the resulting navigation system is both efficient and robust</td>

With careful attention to algorithm efficiency, fast color image segmentation can be accomplished using commodity image capture and CPU hardware. This paper describes a system capable of tracking several hundred regions of up to 32 colors at 30 Hz on general purpose commodity hardware. The software system consists of: a novel implementation of a threshold classifier, a merging system to form regions through connected components, a separation and sorting system that gathers various region features, and a top down merging heuristic to approximate perceptual grouping. A key to the efficiency of our approach is a new method for accomplishing color space thresholding that enables a pixel to be classified into one or more, up to 32 colors, using only two logical AND operations. The algorithms and representations are described, as well as descriptions of three applications in which it has been used.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Instrumenting the physical world through large networks of wireless sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmental monitoring of water and soil, requires that these nodes be very small, lightweight, untethered, and unobtrusive. The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Humanoid service robots performing complex object manipulation tasks need to plan whole-body motions that satisfy a variety of constraints: The robot must keep its balance, self-collisions and collisions with obstacles in the environment must be avoided and, if applicable, the trajectory of the end-effector must follow the constrained motion of a manipulated object in Cartesian space. These constraints and the high number of degrees of freedom make whole-body motion planning for humanoids a challenging problem. In this paper, we present an approach to whole-body motion planning with a focus on the manipulation of articulated objects such as doors and drawers. Our approach is based on rapidly-exploring random trees in combination with inverse kinematics and considers all required constraints during the search. Models of articulated objects hereby generate hand poses for sampled configurations along the trajectory of the object handle. We thoroughly evaluated our planning system and present experiments with a Nao humanoid opening a drawer, a door, and picking up an object. The experiments demonstrate the ability of our framework to generate solutions to complex planning problems and furthermore show that these plans can be reliably executed even on a low-cost humanoid platform.</td>

The arm assembly attaches to a commercially available mobile robot chassis to perform multi-robot coordination. In this work, we present the design of a robot arm and data from experiments to characterize the accuracy and resolution of the force sensing. We describe a force-following manipulation experiment using two robots. The experiment measures strain on a rigid bar between two robots. The data shows the feasibility of using SEAs for force sensing to reduce the strain in the bar.

The use of products from the market makes building robots possible at a very low-cost awakening the engineering nature of students and researchers. In this paper we present a low cost mobile robot which uses a normal laptop to guide itself through a track. The low cost robot involves the use of one or more cameras to control the position of the robot's position relative to the environment. Motors are from battery operated screwdrivers and the interface with the laptop is based on an USB card, recently made available from a data acquisition cards manufacturer. The goal for this work is to build a large set of these robots, lend them to the engineering students and make them participate in a local university contest. Moreover, along the years, the student integrates more and more knowledge in the robot allowing it to perform as better as their knowledge increases along the course.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Previous efforts to employ robots in urban search and rescue applications (USAR) have had limited success due to a number of factors, including cost, accessibility and efficiency. A three-tier system of autonomous mobile robots is proposed and has been constructed to proof-of-concept stage. Importantly, the lowest level of this system comprises a multitude of disposable robots. The system can be implemented at an order of magnitude lower cost than existing systems, dramatically increasing its applicability and versatility. The hardware and software development of this system is discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A method for heading determination is described that will include the effects of pitch and roll as well as the magnetic properties of the vehicle. Using solid-state magnetic sensors and a tilt sensor, a low cost compass system can be realized. Commercial airlines today use attitude and heading reference systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars. For general aviation, or small private aircraft, this is too costly for most pilot's budget. The compass system described here provides heading, pitch and roll outputs accurate to one degree, or better. The shortfall of this low-cost approach is that the compass outputs are affected by acceleration and turns. A solution to this problem is also presented.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A rehabilitation program toward restoring upper limb movements based on neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) depends on closed-loop control performance, which has been limited by the development of sensors for practical daily use. This work proposes a system to obtain force feedback. The system is comprised of a Lycra commercial glove with force sensing resistors (FSRs) attached to the distal phalanxes of the thumb, index and long fingers. After amplification and filtering, the signal is digitized through an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. The polynomial fitting coefficients for the characteristic curves, obtained during the sensor calibration process, were inserted in the software thus enabling the reading of forces exerted during object manipulation. The system was applied to 30 normal subjects in order to verify its feasibility and to acquire knowledge of the normal hand function. Different ways of grasping have been detected according to the Force versus Time curve pattern and to the fingers predominantly used in grasping. Results have also shown the influence of parameters such as gender, age, hand size, and object weight in the normal function. The system did show efficacy. It was able to determine grasp forces during object manipulation for up to 73% of the studied sample. This is significant since a single glove was used in a wide range of subjects. For best results in medical applications, the glove should be tailored to the particular characteristics of an individual user</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Increase robot utilization may be viewed in term of low -cost designs and operations, which are based on the use of products from the market for the robot components. Low-cost robots are related to new emerging application areas. The market components give the possibility to build robots at a low price but they also reduce the capability of robots to specific tasks. Low-cost robots can be also operated in a simpler way compared to the typical industrial robots. In this paper, an overview is presented on low-cost robots by discussing basic characteristics, applications, and motivation for a future success. The importance of low-cost robots can be recognized in the fact that they can be available everywhere at different level of cost and complexity. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to suggest the use of low-cost robots both for teaching and investigation to any teacher and researcher in any Institution with the possibility to achieve significant results both in teach ing and research activities. Particular attention has been addressed to research and teaching activities in University Institutions with the aim to stress the fundamental role of engineers formation in Robotics by using low-cost robots with even novel solutions for. Examples of a successful activity by using low-cost robots have been illustrated as those developed at LARM, the Laboratory of Robotics and Mechatronics in Cassino, Italy.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Distributed sensor networks have been proposed for a wide range of applications. The main purpose of a sensor network is to monitor an area, including detecting, identifying, localizing, and tracking one or more objects of interest. These networks may be used by the military in surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat scenarios or around the perimeter of a manufacturing plant for intrusion detection. In other applications such as hearing aids and multimedia, microphone networks are capable of enhancing audio signals under noisy conditions for improved intelligibility, recognition, and cuing for camera aiming. Previous developments in integrated circuit technology have allowed the construction of low-cost miniature sensor nodes with signal processing and wireless communication capabilities. These technological advances not only open up many possibilities but also introduce challenging issues for the collaborative processing of wideband acoustic and seismic signals for source localization and beamforming in an energy-constrained distributed sensor network. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of these issues</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Humanoid robot with dual manipulators and dexterous hands shows great significance in domestic, medical and service applications. They can provide companion, operation, manipulation, material handling and many other services to human beings. However, current humanoid robots are either too expansive or too clumsy. There is a trade-off between robot flexibility and costs. It is a huge obstacle blocking the road of humanoid robot toward our daily life. In this paper, the design and implementation of a low cost dual wheel and dual arm humanoid robotic platform is introduced. The robot is based on the open source 3D printed humanoid robot “InMoov”. To fully explore the potential of “InMoov”, we redesigned its electrical system based on the developed Embedded Controller, and equipped it with a Mini PC and a touch screen for human-robot interaction. By using the 485 bus and modbus protocol, the wiring complexity is greatly decreased. A differential drive mobile platform is integrated to enable the robot with mobility and furthermore, a data glove system is also designed to explore a new type of robot programming technology. Robot Operating System(ROS) is used to realize the robot control and human-robot interaction. Comparing to the existing humanoid robots, the developed humanoid robotic platform is low cost but has fully functionality.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Hyper-redundant manipulators can be fragile, expensive, and limited in their flexibility due to the distributed and bulky actuators that are typically used to achieve the precision and degrees of freedom (DOFs) required. Here, a manipulator is proposed that is robust, high-force, low-cost, and highly articulated without employing traditional actuators mounted at the manipulator joints. Rather, local tunable stiffness is coupled with off-board spooler motors and tension cables to achieve complex manipulator configurations. Tunable stiffness is achieved by reversible jamming of granular media, which-by applying a vacuum to enclosed grains-causes the grains to transition between solid-like states and liquid-like ones. Experimental studies were conducted to identify grains with high strength-to-weight performance. A prototype of the manipulator is presented with performance analysis, with emphasis on speed, strength, and articulation. This novel design for a manipulator-and use of jamming for robotic applications in general-could greatly benefit applications such as human-safe robotics and systems in which robots need to exhibit high flexibility to conform to their environments.</td>

A simple DR construction is adopted to improve the performance of both pure land DR navigation and DR/GPS integration system. In order to overcome the flaws of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the sigma-point KF (SPKF) is merged with the receding-horizon strategy. This filter has several advantages over the EKF, the SPKF, and the RHKF filter. The advantages include the robustness to the system model uncertainty, the initial estimation error, temporary unknown bias, etc. The computational burden is reduced. Especially, the proposed filter works well even in the case of exiting the unmodeled random walk of the inertial sensors, which can occur in the microelectromechanical systems' inertial sensors by temperature variation. Therefore, the SPRHKF filter can provide the navigation information with good quality in the DR/GPS integration system for land navigation seamlessly</td>

A consistent error model for estimating position and orientation errors has been developed. Previous work on propagating odometry error covariance relies on incrementally updating the covariance matrix in small time steps. The approach taken here sums the noise theoretically over the entire path length to produce simple closed form expressions, allowing efficient covariance matrix updating after the completion of path segments. Systematic errors due to wheel radius and wheel base measurement were first calibrated with UMBmark test.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Work in simultaneous localisation and map-building ("SLAM") for mobile robots has focused on the simplified case in which a robot is considered to move in two dimensions on a ground plane. While this is often a good approximation, a large number of real-world applications require robots to move around terrain which has significant slopes and undulations, and it is desirable that these robots too should be able to estimate their locations by building maps of natural features. We describe a real-time EKF-based-SLAM system permitting unconstrained 3D localisation, and in particular develop models for the motion of a wheeled robot in the presence of unknown slope variations. In a fully automatic implementation, our robot observes visual point features using fixating stereo vision and builds a sparse map on-the-fly. Combining this visual measurement with information from odometry and a roll/pitch accelerometer sensor, the robot performs accurate, repeatable localisation while traversing an undulating course.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new method for improving the accuracy of inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on land vehicles. The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms</td>

However, the sheer size of these unstructured environments (for example Australia's Great Barrier Reef) pose a number of challenges for current monitoring platforms which are typically remote operated and required significant resources and infrastructure. Therefore, a primary objective of the CSIRO robotic reef monitoring project is to develop and deploy a large number of AUV teams to perform broadscale reef surveying. In order to achieve this, the platforms must be cheap, even possibly disposable. This work presents the results of a preliminary investigation into the performance of a low-cost sensor suite and associated processing techniques for vision and inertial-based navigation within a highly unstructured reef environment.</td>

The design principle underlying this vehicle, which is called CORTEX-II, is the space-variant visual architecture of visual cortex. This allows a wide visual field and high resolution to be maintained in a small and relatively inexpensive system. With a total weight of under twenty kg and size of about .5 meters, CORTEX-II incorporates a three degree of freedom active vision system (pan, tilt and zoom) mounted on a 1 degree of freedom “neck”, 160 Mflops (loosely coupled array of four TI320C40 parallel DSP's) and 48 megabytes of memory. Topics discussed here are modification of a stock RC vehicle platform, integration of the parallel DSP platform, active vision system, battery and power systems, communications, and a programming environment for development of the real-time parallel tasks that is transparently portable between simulation and robot run time contexts. Potential applications for systems of this type include traffic monitoring, autonomous driving research, security and surveillance, space-exploration, smart weapons systems, and other application domains in which small, low-cost, high performance visually guided robots are required</td>

Our system consists of three components: a monocular SLAM system, an extended Kalman filter for data fusion and state estimation and a PID controller to generate steering commands. Next to a working system, the main contribution of this paper is a novel, closed-form solution to estimate the absolute scale of the generated visual map from inertial and altitude measurements. In an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our system is able to navigate in previously unknown environments at absolute scale without requiring artificial markers or external sensors. Furthermore, we show (1) its robustness to temporary loss of visual tracking and significant delays in the communication process, (2) the elimination of odometry drift as a result of the visual SLAM system and (3) accurate, scale-aware pose estimation and navigation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Stapedotomy is a standard ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgery, where the surgeons use surgical micro hooks and forceps to replace the stapes with a small titanium implant. However, there are some challenges with this procedure. Especially, the non-ergonomic posture of the surgeon increases the hand tremor and leads to an inaccurate positioning of the implant. This may cause hearing loss and the patient may need a revision operation. In this paper, we present the first laser sintered disposable manipulator for ENT surgery, which allows the surgeon to move a micro hook in three directions via a joystick console, while his/her hands are located on an armrest. This may increase the surgical outcome by enhancing the ergonomics and therefore may reduce the number of revision operations. We show that the fabrication cost of the single-use robot does not increase the operation expenses drastically. To conclude, our preliminary evaluation with a middle ear phantom indicates that a basic surgical maneuver can be performed via the presented robotic system.</td>

The robots are designed for long-term missions and it is envisioned they can be deployed in swarms. They are self-powered and the electrical energy is scavenged by using solar cells and by using a novel application of the thermo-generator (Seebeck effect). The robots move passively transported by sea currents and winds taking inspiration by the locomotion of the Physalia physalis jellyfish. To monitor the water parameters also in depth a variable buoyancy device was developed to modify the volume of a bladder using as source of energy the sun radiation and the sea water temperature. This system allows the robot to move passively and cyclically along the water column.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we describe our autonomous vision-based quadrotor MAV system which maps and explores unknown environments. All algorithms necessary for autonomous mapping and exploration run on-board the MAV. Using a front-looking stereo camera as the main exteroceptive sensor, our quadrotor achieves these capabilities with both the Vector Field Histogram+ (VFH+) algorithm for local navigation, and the frontier-based exploration algorithm. In addition, we implement the Bug algorithm for autonomous wall-following which could optionally be selected as the substitute exploration algorithm in sparse environments where the frontier-based exploration under-performs. We incrementally build a 3D global occupancy map on-board the MAV. The map is used by the VFH+ and frontier-based exploration in dense environments, and the Bug algorithm for wall-following in sparse environments. During the exploration phase, images from the front-looking camera are transmitted over Wi-Fi to the ground station. These images are input to a large-scale visual SLAM process running off-board on the ground station. SLAM is carried out with pose-graph optimization and loop closure detection using a vocabulary tree. We improve the robustness of the pose estimation by fusing optical flow and visual odometry. Optical flow data is provided by a customized downward-looking camera integrated with a microcontroller while visual odometry measurements are derived from the front-looking stereo camera. We verify our approaches with experimental results.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Part II of the tutorial has summarized the remaining building blocks of the VO pipeline: specifically, how to detect and match salient and repeatable features across frames and robust estimation in the presence of outliers and bundle adjustment. In addition, error propagation, applications, and links to publicly available code are included. VO is a well understood and established part of robotics. VO has reached a maturity that has allowed us to successfully use it for certain classes of applications: space, ground, aerial, and underwater. In the presence of loop closures, VO can be used as a building block for a complete SLAM algorithm to reduce motion drift. Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for VO to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved. Eventually, VO has the potential to replace Lidar-based systems for egomotion estimation, which are currently leading the state of the art in accuracy, robustness, and reliability. VO offers a cheaper and mechanically easier-to-manufacture solution for egomotion estimation, while, additionally, being fully passive. Furthermore, the ongoing miniaturization of digital cameras offers the possibility to develop smaller and smaller robotic systems capable of ego-motion estimation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A low cost strategy based on well calibrated odometry is presented for localizing mobile robots. The paper describes a two-step process for correction of `systematic errors' in encoder measurements followed by fusion of the calibrated odometry with a gyroscope and GPS resulting in a robust localization scheme. A Kalman filter operating on data from the sensors is used for estimating position and orientation of the robot. Experimental results are presented that show an improvement of at least one order of magnitude in accuracy compared to the un-calibrated, un-filtered case. Our method is systematic, simple and yields very good results. We show that this strategy proves useful when the robot is using GPS to localize itself as well as when GPS becomes unavailable for some time. As a result robot can move in and out of enclosed spaces, such as buildings, while keeping track of its position on the fly</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: GPS and low-cost INS sensors are widely used for positioning and attitude determination applications. Low-cost inertial sensors exhibit large errors that can be compensated using position and velocity updates from GPS. Combining both sensors using a Kalman filter provides high-accuracy, real-time navigation. A conventional Kalman filter relies on the correct definition of the measurement and process noise matrices, which are generally defined a priori and remain fixed throughout the processing run. Adaptive Kalman filtering techniques use the residual sequences to adapt the stochastic properties of the filter on line to correspond to the temporal dependence of the errors involved. This paper examines the use of three adaptive filtering techniques. These are artificially scaling the predicted Kalman filter covariance, the Adaptive Kalman Filter and Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation. The algorithms are tested with the GPS and inertial data simulation software. A trajectory taken from a real marine trial is used to test the dynamic alignment of the inertial sensor errors. Results show that on line estimation of the stochastic properties of the inertial system can significantly improve the speed of the dynamic alignment and potentially improve the overall navigation accuracy and integrity.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical speed sensors at the motor shaft have the attractions of low cost and high reliability. To replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals. Vector-controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine. The overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Biped robots have better mobility than conventional wheeled robots, but they tend to tip over easily. To be able to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary for the robot to adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, and maintain its stability with a torso motion. When the ground conditions and stability constraint are satisfied, it is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. We first formulate the constraints of the foot motion parameters. By varying the values of the constraint parameters, we can produce different types of foot motion to adapt to ground conditions. We then propose a method for formulating the problem of the smooth hip motion with the largest stability margin using only two parameters, and derive the hip trajectory by iterative computation. Finally, the correlation between the actuator specifications and the walking patterns is described through simulation studies, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by simulation examples and experimental results</td>

Since danger might happen to patients, especially without the supervision of therapist, a monitoring system should be developed. In this paper, a preliminary work is conducted to provide an online monitoring system to replace the therapist role to automatically monitor patient during the physical therapy activities by using a stepper. However, the main objective of this paper is to propose methods that can improve recognition rate of human gesture by implying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on features and then propose Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier. In order to accurately identify gesture of patients such as falling down during physical activities, angle features calculated from the information of head and torso positions is proposed as input data. A low cost RGB and depth camera will be used to track and capture the skeleton joint position of the patient. LDA of joint angles is proposed as feature in this research. The feature extracted will be analysed and classified using SVM to recognize the type of gestures performed by the patient during rehabilitation. As any abnormal gesture was recognized, the system will provide information to be used as an alarm for further supervision by the therapist.</td>

The INS/GPS navigation loop provides continuous and reliable navigation solutions to the guidance and flight control loop for autonomous flight. With additional air data and engine thrust data, the guidance loop computes the guidance demands to follow way-point scenarios. The flight control loop generates actuator signals for the control surfaces and thrust vector. The whole GNC algorithm was implemented within an embedded flight control computer. The real-time flight test results show that the vehicle can perform the autonomous flight reliably even under high maneuvering scenarios.</td>

In this paper, we propose a framework for applying the same techniques to visual imagery. We match visual frames with large numbers of point features, using classic bundle adjustment techniques from computational vision, but we keep only relative frame pose information (a skeleton). The skeleton is a reduced nonlinear system that is a faithful approximation of the larger system and can be used to solve large loop closures quickly, as well as forming a backbone for data association and local registration. We illustrate the workings of the system with large outdoor datasets (10 km), showing large-scale loop closure and precise localization in real time.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Many indoor robotics systems use laser rangefinders as their primary sensor for mapping, localization, and obstacle avoidance. The cost and power of such systems is a major roadblock to the deployment of lowcost, efficient consumer robot platforms for home use. In this paper, we describe a compact, planar laser distance sensor (LDS) that has capabilities comparable to current laser scanners: 3 cm accuracy out to 6 m, 10 Hz acquisition, and 1 degree resolution over a full 360 degree scan. The build cost of this device, using COTS electronics and custom mechanical tooling, is under $30.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Navigation is a basic skill for autonomous robots. In the last years human–robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.</td>

In order to improve the covering of the explored zone the robots show different behaviours (routine, normal and anxious) and cooperate by transferring each other the perceived environment when they meet; therefore, not all the information of the non-returning robots is lost provided that they had encountered robots that safely returned. The returning robots deliver to a host their perceived and communicated (by other robots) partial maps and the host incrementally generates the most plausible map of the environment. To perform the map generation, a fusion, completion and alignment process of the partial maps, based on fuzzy techniques, has been developed.</td>

The extensive hobbyist community has tended to focus on the hardware and the low-level software aspects. We claim that there is a need for a low-cost, general-purpose robot, accessible to the hobbyist community, with sufficient computation and sensing to run “research-grade” software. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of such a robot. We explicitly outline our design goals, and show how a capable robot can be assembled from off-the-shelf parts, for a modest cost, by a single person with only a few tools. We also show how the robot can be used as a low-cost telepresence platform, giving the system a concrete purpose beyond being a low-cost development platform.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a novel low-cost position detection prototype from practical design to implementation of its control schemes. This prototype is designed to provide mobile robot swarms with advanced sensing capabilities in an efficient, cost-effective way. From the observation of bats' foraging behaviors, the prototype with a particular emphasis on variable rotation range and speed, as well as 360° observation capability has been developed. The prototype also aims at giving each robot reliable information about identification of neighboring robots from objects and their positions. For this purpose, an observation algorithm-based sensor is proposed. The implementation details are explained, and the effectiveness of the control schemes is verified through extensive experiments. The sensor provides real-time location of stationary targets positioned 100 cm away within an average error of 2.6 cm. Moreover, experimental results show that the prototype observation capability can be quite satisfactory for practical use of mobile robot swarms.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes a geometry-based robot calibration method for a 6-DOF robot manipulator. The calibration device only includes a set of light projections consisting of three laser beams. In the proposed calibration algorithm, the coordinates of the laser spots on the table in the world coordinate system is first obtained by processing the image data from a CCD camera fixed above. Based on that, the mapping between the world coordinate system and the robot base coordinate system can then be utilized to locate the robot within its environment by some geometric analysis. The calibration method proposed in the paper is extremely suitable for the fast calibration of a multi-robot cooperation system due to the low cost of the calibration device and the simplicity of the algorithm involved. Some experimental results for a RH6 robot are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed calibration method.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Zero velocity update (ZUPT) is an effective way for pedestrian navigation in a GPS (Global Positioning System) denied environment. The stance phase in each step provides zero velocity measurement for IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) drift correction. Most previous research, however, gives navigation solutions only for pedestrian walking but not running. Compared with walking, running has a shorter stance phase with qualified as zero velocity. Therefore a stance phase detector for walking may not be capable for running. This paper presents a novel ZUPT algorithm which can achieve robust pedestrian navigation for walking, stair climbing, and running. Our stance phase detector consists of one footstep detector and two zero velocity detectors (ZVDs).The footstep detector is used to mark each new step, and the first ZVD (ZVD1) can successfully detect zero velocity while walking by setting thresholds on both gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. While ZVD1 is failed for running, the second ZVD (ZVD2) is introduced with a relative larger threshold on gyroscope measurement only. The proposed stance phase detector was tested for walking, running and stair climbing. In all cases, most of the footsteps are detected correctly and our ZUPT algorithm can be successfully implemented. Experimental results show that the navigation accuracy of the proposed algorithm for running cases is comparable to that of walking only cases. Tests on a biped robot are being also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.</td>

This problem arises in applications that require choosing how to arrange or how to move objects without collisions. The approach presented here is based on characterizing the position and orientation of an object as a single point in a configuration space, in which each coordinate represents a degree of freedom in the position or orientation of the object. The configurations forbidden to this object, due to the presence of other objects, can then be characterized as regions in the configuration space, called configuration space obstacles. The paper presents algorithms for computing these configuration space obstacles when the objects are polygons or polyhedra.</td>

In many scenarios an integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design. An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea / lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped / not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-robot manipulation allows for scalable environmental interaction, which is critical for multi-robot systems to have an impact on our world. A successful manipulation model requires cost-effective robots, robust hardware, and proper system feedback and control. This paper details key sensing and manipulator capabilities of the r-one robot. The r-one robot is an advanced, open source, low-cost platform for multi-robot manipulation and sensing that meets all of these requirements. The parts cost is around $250 per robot. The r-one has a rich sensor suite, including a flexible IR communication/localization/obstacle detection system, high-precision quadrature encoders, gyroscope, accelerometer, integrated bump sensor, and light sensors. Two years of working with these robots inspired the development of an external manipulator that gives the robots the ability to interact with their environment. This paper presents an overview of the r-one, the r-one manipulator, and basic manipulation experiments to illustrate the efficacy our design. The advanced design, low cost, and small size can support university research with large populations of robots and multi-robot curriculum in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. We conclude with remarks on the future implementation of the manipulators and expected work to follow.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes a new compact bending and disposable (to avoid nosocomial contaminations) plastic wrist for minimally invasive surgery with a large free space for several connections such as electrical wires, fiberoptics and fluidic tubes, etc. It uses small partially locked ball joints to increase the dexterity of surgical tools in all directions contrary to other wrists using several successive orthogonal joints. This compact wrist is a generic concept comprises at least two vertebrae composed of non-attached contacts: plastic plates and balls. Six metal wires drive the position of each vertebra and several other free wires allow the locking of wrist axial rotations. Analytic and finite element simulations allow an evaluation of the mechanical rigidity of the wrist by several parameters: the wire number, diameter, position, mechanical properties and the general geometry of the wrist. The wrist is fabricated with 6 mm biocompatible plastic vertebrae micromachined by low cost water jet cutting. It uses 0.3 mm NiTi super-elastic wires for its mechanical structure which enable two degrees of freedom (DOF) in any directions between -85 degrees and 85 degrees. The two DOFs of the wrist and the DOF of the forceps are driven by a handled basic system using pulleys, 0.5mm Topline® ropes connected to NiTi wires and four RC-servomotors. In the first prototype 6 electrical wires, 2 micro-light emitters and 4 fiberoptics were successfully integrated. We are convinced of the effectiveness of this compact disposable plastic wrist, to be used with a usual or a motorised handled surgical instrument and integrating new functionalities such as electrical/optical/fluidics connections for smart surgical embedded micro-systems like micro-sensors and micro-actuators.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Vision feedback control loop techniques are efficient for a large class of applications, but they come up against difficulties when the initial and desired robot positions are distant. Classical approaches are based on the regulation to zero of an error function computed from the current measurement and a constant desired one. By using such an approach, it is not obvious how to introduce any constraint in the realized trajectories or to ensure the convergence for all the initial configurations. In this paper, we propose a new approach to resolve these difficulties by coupling path planning in image space and image-based control. Constraints such that the object remains in the camera field of view or the robot avoids its joint limits can be taken into account at the task planning level. Furthermore, by using this approach, current measurements always remain close to their desired value, and a control by image-based servoing ensures robustness with respect to modeling errors. The proposed method is based on the potential field approach and is applied whether the object shape and dimensions are known or not, and when the calibration parameters of the camera are well or badly estimated. Finally, real-time experimental results using an eye-in-hand robotic system are presented and confirm the validity of our approach.</td>

In some instances, a power wheelchair also cannot be used, usually because of the difficulty the person has in controlling it (often due to additional disabilities). This paper describes two low-cost robotic wheelchair prototypes that assist the operator of the chair in avoiding obstacles, going to pre-designated places, and maneuvering through doorways and other narrow or crowded areas. These systems can be interfaced to a variety of input devices, and can give the operator as much or as little moment by moment control of the chair as they wish.

Moreover, they are attractive for students which increases their motivation to learn. However, the requirements of an effective education tool bring new constraints to robotics. This article presents the e-puck robot design, which specifically targets engineering education at university level. Thanks to its particular design, the e-puck can be used in a large spectrum of teaching activities, not strictly related to robotics.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery prevents surgeons from manually palpating organs to locate sub-surface tumors and other structures. One solution is to use ultrasound; however, it is not always reliable. Tactile sensor arrays have been proposed as an alternative or complementary modality, but current designs have drawbacks including a large number of wires, lack of autoclavability or disposability and high cost. In this paper, four mass-producible, low-cost, sterilizable tactile sensor array designs with minimal wires are presented. Both piezoresistive and capacitive versions have been designed, each with a 2 2 mm spatial resolution and a scan rate of 30 Hz. Two sizes with 48 or 90 sensing elements are presented for each version. The sensing elements can measure contact pressures with 1 kPa resolution and they have over 84% accuracy in the 25–150 kPa range. The low cost allows the sensors to be made disposable, avoiding the deterioration in performance resulting from repeated autoclaving. The sensors include the analog-todigital conversion circuit onboard, requiring only two power lines and two digital signal lines to connect them. The small number of output wires allows the sensors to be incorporated into robotic surgical instruments with articulated wrists that do not have the space for a large number of wires. Both sensor versions are shown to be able to detect 6 mm diameter tumors at a depth of 10 mm in a silicone phantom and in ex vivo tissue samples.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We present a system that estimates the motion of a stereo head or a single moving camera based on video input. The system operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated purely from images over previously unseen distances and periods of time.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The relatively high cost of inertial navigation systems (INSs) has been preventing their integration with global positioning systems (GPSs) for land-vehicle applications. Inertial sensors based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology have recently become commercially available at lower costs. These relatively lower cost inertial sensors have the potential to allow the development of an affordable GPS-aided INS (INS/GPS) vehicular navigation system. While MEMS-based INS is inherently immune to signal jamming, spoofing, and blockage vulnerabilities (as opposed to GPS), the performance of MEMS-based gyroscopes and accelerometers is significantly affected by complex error characteristics that are stochastic in nature. To improve the overall performance of MEMS-based INS/GPS, this paper proposes the following two-tier approach at different levels: (1) improving the stochastic modeling of MEMS-based inertial sensor errors using autoregressive processes at the raw measurement level and (2) enhancing the positioning accuracy during GPS outages by nonlinear modeling of INS position errors at the information fusion level using neuro-fuzzy (NF) modules, which are augmented in the Kalman filtering INS/GPS integration. Experimental road tests involving a MEMS-based INS were performed, which validated the efficacy of the proposed methods on several trajectories.</td>

The complete design and mode of operation was demonstrated, and the production of the complete system was also demonstrated by building a microcontroller based hardware system which was used to actuate a soft robot for bending motion. The whole system including the electronic circuit board and actuation components was embedded in a 3D-printed casing to ensure a compact approach for actuating soft robots. Results show the viability of the system in actuating and controlling silicon-based soft robots to achieve bending motions. Qualitative measurements of the bending distance and pressure were obtained using this system. This electronic design is easy to reproduce and integrate into any specified soft robotic device requiring pneumatic actuation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The problem of robot drilling presents a significant challenge, due to the comparatively low mechanical stiffness of typical serial industrial robots. This compliance makes the robot deflect due to the cutting forces, resulting in poor hole quality. Recently, functionality for high-bandwidth force control has found its way into industrial robot control systems. This could potentially open up the possibility of robotic drilling systems with improved performance, using only standard systems without costly extra hardware and calibration techniques. In this paper, we present methods and systems for force-controlled robot drilling, based on active suppression of drill sliding through a model-based force control scheme. The methods are validated in a number of drilling experiments using an industrial robot.</td>

The ability to print robots introduces a fast and low-cost fabrication method to modern, real-world robotic applications. To this end, we employ laser-engraved origami patterns to build a new class of robotic systems for mobility and manipulation. Origami is suitable for printable robotics as it uses only a flat sheet as the base structure for building complicated functional shapes, which can be utilized as robot bodies. An arbitrarily complex folding pattern can be used to yield an array of functionalities, in the form of actuated hinges or active spring elements. For actuation, we use compact NiTi coil actuators placed on the body to move parts of the structure on-demand. We demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept case study, the end-to-end fabrication and assembly of a simple mobile robot that can undergo worm-like peristaltic locomotion.</td>

Of course, fine motion without the use of an expensive differential device is not an easy task, even now that available precision has been greatly improved as the military encoding has been removed. In this paper we present a localization algorithm based on Kalman filtering that tries to fuse information coming from an inexpensive single GPS with inertial data and map-based data. The algorithm is able to produce an estimated configuration for the robot that can be successfully fed back in a navigation system.

The determination of optimal paths and sampling strategies that effectively utilize available resources is critical to these missions. Recent work performed jointly at RPI and AUSI on the development of adaptive sampling algorithms (ASA) utilizes information measures, estimation theory, and potential fields to direct the robots to the locations in space most likely to yield information about the sensed field variable of interest. Typical sensory information can consist of spatial distribution of one or more field variables, such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, current, etc. In order to test our algorithms we have created the MATCON simulation environment, an underwater experimental platform using solar AUVs, and a land-based experimental testbed using inexpensive wheeled robots.</td>

In order to efficiently solve the task at hand, the robots often need accurate localization. In this work, we address the localization problem by developing a solution that has low computational and sensing requirements, and that is easily deployed on large robot teams composed of cheap robots. We build upon a real-time, particle-filter based localization algorithm that is completely decentralized and scalable, and accommodates realistic robot assumptions including noisy sensors, and asynchronous and lossy communication. In order to further reduce this algorithm's overall complexity, we propose a low-cost particle clustering method, which is particularly well suited to the collaborative localization problem. Our approach is experimentally validated on a team of ten real robots.</td>

The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance. A new, human-safe design is also described: the arm uses stepper motors with a series-elastic transmission for the proximal four degrees of freedom (DOF), and non-series-elastic robotics servos for the distal three DOF. Tradeoffs of the design are discussed, especially in the areas of human safety and control bandwidth. The arm is used to demonstrate pancake cooking (pouring batter, flipping pancakes), using the intrinsic compliance of the arm to aid in interaction with objects.</td>

In this paper, we derive and analyze distributed state estimators of dynamical stochastic processes, whereby the low communication cost is effected by requiring the transmission of a single bit per observation. Following a Kalman filtering (KF) approach, we develop recursive algorithms for distributed state estimation based on the sign of innovations (SOI). Even though SOI-KF can afford minimal communication overhead, we prove that in terms of performance and complexity it comes very close to the clairvoyant KF which is based on the analog-amplitude observations. Reinforcing our conclusions, we show that the SOI-KF applied to distributed target tracking based on distance-only observations yields accurate estimates at low communication cost</td>

Complete information about a freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function, called a navigation function, that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all initial free configurations. A formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world is developed. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disk by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint disks representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation. Simulation results for planar scenarios are provided</td>

These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Visual odometry (VO) is the process of estimating the egomotion of an agent (e.g., vehicle, human, and robot) using only the input of a single or If multiple cameras attached to it. Application domains include robotics, wearable computing, augmented reality, and automotive. The term VO was coined in 2004 by Nister in his landmark paper. The term was chosen for its similarity to wheel odometry, which incrementally estimates the motion of a vehicle by integrating the number of turns of its wheels over time. Likewise, VO operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras. For VO to work effectively, there should be sufficient illumination in the environment and a static scene with enough texture to allow apparent motion to be extracted. Furthermore, consecutive frames should be captured by ensuring that they have sufficient scene overlap.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents prototype implementation of low-cost, open hardware, static - gesture recognition system. The implemented system has three major components: A Glove and Sensor Unit (GSU) - consisting of a pair of gloves embedded with custom made, low-cost flex and contact sensors, a Primary Supporting Hardware (PSH) that maps change in input values from GSU, a Secondary Supporting Hardware (SSH) that processes the input values and recognizes the gesture accurately. When a gesture is signed, the GSU tracks the change in orientation of the fingers, which results in a change in voltage levels of the sensors. This change is mapped by the PSH and passed on to SSH which comprises of two ATmega328P microcontrollers, one connected to each of the glove. The two microcontrollers are connected in a master-slave configuration and communication between them is facilitated through an XBee module. The performance of this gesture recognition system is evaluated using a data set comprising of 36 unique gestures. These gestures represent a total of 120 gestures that include all gestures across five globally used sign languages. A gesture recognition engine that resides in the master microcontroller processes the input and identifies the gesture. The gesture recognition engine comprises of a two stage selection-elimination embedded intelligence algorithm that is used to enhance the system efficiency from 83.1% to 94.5% without any additional hardware. The cost of the system is USD 30, which the authors believe on commercialization, could be brought under USD 9.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Low-cost inertial sensors are characterized by high noise and large uncertainties in the outputs such as bias, scale factor and non-orthogonality. Consequently, errors associated with a low-cost INS in terms of position, velocity and attitude grow rapidly in stand-alone mode. If good performance can be achieved with low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs), cost in existing applications can be reduced and the development of new applications may be made feasible. As most of the uncertainties exist in the sensor error behaviour, calibration would improve the accuracy significantly. Intensive calibration, however, would also increase the cost of using an IMU. Another way to improve the accuracy will be by augmenting the IMU with many other aiding sensors: for example, odometers or speedometers. Choosing an appropriate estimation method is a key problem when developing an aided INS. Currently, there are three approaches: (i) traditional linearized Kalman filter (LKF) or the extended Kalman filter (EKF); (ii) sampling-based filtering such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and particle filters; (iii) artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neural fuzzy information systems (ANFIS). Of these approaches,the performance of the UKF is compared to that of other existing methods. The performance of the unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) is also compared with that of the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother. Tests have been conducted using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based IMUs. The most remarkable advantage of the UKF over existing methods is that it can handle large and small attitude errors seamlessly. Thus, the UKF is preferred in situations such as those where the heading error approaches the limit of what an EKF/LKF can deal with efficiently. The EKF/RTS approach would still be chosen if the attitude errors can be kept small such that the error dynamics are linear. The UKF can unify INS error models, although it cannot deal with complete uncertainties in attitude Therefore, the development stage can be simplified by using the UKF.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Since the usage of high performance inertial navigation systems (INSs) is limited by their high price and the regulation by the government, low cost INSs are used for general application areas. However, low cost INSs can experience large positioning errors in very short time due to the low quality of the inertial measuring unit (IMU). To overcome the limitations of low cost INSs, several techniques were developed and tested using the NovAtel Black Diamond System (BDSTM). A new field calibration method was developed and tested successfully. It is not needed to align the IMU to the local level frame with the method. Furthermore, the bias estimation of the calibration method is not affected by the reference gravity error. Almost half of the positioning error could be removed with the accelerometer calibration information. The mechanization and navigation Kalman filter were implemented based on the navigation frame to test the velocity matching alignment and non-holonomic constraints. The velocity matching alignment technique was tested for the IMUs to which stationary alignment technique cannot be applied. All attitude components converged within three minutes with RMS 0.03◦. Non-holonomic constraints dramatically reduced the horizontal positioning error, within 40 m for 20 minutes operation. Therefore, low cost INSs can be used as a stand-alone positioning system during the GPS outages of over 10 minutes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Navigation Templates, a set of tools for constructing flexible plans for a mobile robot's local navigation, is described. A Navigation Template-based plan for action is environment-relative. The plan places qualitative constraints on the robot's actions as a function of the robot's internal model of its surroundings. Because these constraints bound the robot's motions, rather than dictating a particular trajectory, the plan is able to flex with the robot's changing perceptions of the world. Quantitative actuator control is obtained through the use of a transformation function that maps the qualitative plan into a currently preferred direction of travel for the robot. The transformation is computationally inexpensive, allowing the quantitative control to be updated rapidly, thus keeping the robot's actions in step with the qualitative plan and its perceptions of the world. This work is implemented and running on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's planetary exploration mobile robot as well as MITRE's Denning mobile robot</td>

To this end we propose an energy function which aims at finding the best rigid body motion to map one RGB-D image into another one, assuming a static scene filmed by a moving camera. We then propose a linearization of the energy function which leads to a 6×6 normal equation for the twist coordinates representing the rigid body motion. To allow for larger motions, we solve this equation in a coarse-to-fine scheme. Extensive quantitative analysis on recently proposed benchmark datasets shows that the proposed solution is faster than a state-of-the-art implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm by two orders of magnitude. While ICP is more robust to large camera motion, the proposed method gives better results in the regime of small displacements which are often the case in camera tracking applications.</td>

Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively.

Th us in tegrit y encapsulates reliabilit y while the rev erse is not necessarily true. This thesis pro vides, b oth in practical and theoretical terms, the fusion pro- cesses adopted and the implemen tation of fault detection tec hniques required for a high in tegrit y aided inertial na vigation system. There are three main con tributions: Firstly , the dev elopmen t of an aided inertial na vigation system using the Global Na vigation Satellite System (GNSS) as an aiding source for use in autonomous land v ehicles. This is accomplished b y using a Kalman lter as the estimation algorithm along with the addition of fault detection tec hniques so as to increase the in tegrit y of the system. The real time structure of the na vigation arc hitecture is pro vided along with results of its implemen tation in an autonomous 65 tonne straddle carrier. Ho w ev er, the algorithm dev elopmen t pro vides a generic structure th us allo wing the use of the na vigation suite on an y land v ehicle. Secondly is the use of v ehicle mo delling to b ound drift errors asso ciated with inertial na vigation. This pro vides a sensor-free aiding source due to the inheren t constrained motion of land v ehicles. V ehicle constrain ts can th us be used as an extra aiding source with other sensors whic h in turn impro v es the accuracy and in tegrit y of the o v erall na vigation system. This is demonstrated with the real time implemen tation of an inertial na vigation system b eing aided b y three separate aiding sources; GNSS, v ehicle mo delling and sp eed data pro vided b y an enco der. Finally , the understanding of the e ect of inertial sensor redundancy to na vigation accuracy and fault detection is addressed. A redundan t inertial measuremen t unit is dev elop ed and tested and pro vides the necessary ph ysical sensor for future fault detec- tion w ork. This concludes this thesis b y pro viding the foundation for the autonomous detection of faults in inertial units and furthermore the nal lev el of in tegrit y required for a na vigation system.</td>

The paper focuses on the issue of achieving the integrity required of the navigation loop for use in autonomous systems. The paper highlights the detection of possible faults both before and during the fusion process in order to enhance the integrity of the navigation loop. The implementation of this fault detection methodology considers both low frequency faults in the IMU caused by bias in the sensor readings and the misalignment of the unit, and high frequency faults from the GPS receiver caused by multipath errors. The implementation, based on a low-cost, strapdown IMU, aided by either standard or carrier phase GPS technologies, is described. Results of the fusion process are presented</td>

UAVs systems have been proposed for a wide range of applications such as mapping, surveillance, search, and tracking operations. The recent availability of low-cost UAVs suggests the use of teams of vehicles to perform sensing tasks. To leverage the capabilities of a team of vehicles, efficient methods of decentralized sensing and cooperative path planning are necessary. The goal of this work is to examine practical control strategies for a team of fixed-wing vehicles performing cooperative sensing. We seek to develop decentralized, autonomous control strategies that can account for a wide variety of sensing missions. Sensing goals are posed from an information theoretic standpoint to design strategies that explicitly minimize uncertainty. This work proposes a tightly coupled approach, in which sensor models and estimation objectives are used online for path planning.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: User requirements for the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based road applications have been significantly increasing in recent years. Safety systems based on vehicle localization, electronic fee-collection systems, and traveler information services are just a few examples of interesting applications requiring onboard equipment (OBE) capable of offering a high available accurate position, even in unfriendly environments with low satellite visibility such as built-up areas or tunnels and at low cost. In addition to that, users and service providers demand from the OBEs not only accurate continuous positioning but integrity information of the reliability of this position as well. Specifically, in life-critical applications, high-integrity monitored positioning is absolutely required. This paper presents a solution based on the fusion of GNSS and inertial sensors (a Global Positioning System/satellite-based augmentation system/inertial navigation system integrated system) running an extended Kalman filter combined with an interactive multimodel method (IMM-EKF). The solution developed in this paper supplies continuous positioning in marketable conditions and a meaningful trust level of the given solution. A set of tests performed in controlled and real scenarios proves the suitability of the proposed IMM-EKF implementation as compared with low-cost GNSS-based solutions, dead reckoning systems, single-model EKF, and other filtering approaches of the current literature.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate optimal robot motion based on a sequence of attractor dynamics in task space. This is motivated by the biological evidence that movements in the motor cortex of animals are encoded in a similar fashion- and by the need for compact movement representations on which efficient optimization can be performed. We represent the motion as a sequence of attractor points acting in the task space of the motion. Based on this compact and robust representation, we present a scheme to generate optimal movements. Unlike traditional optimization techniques, this optimization is performed on the low-dimensional representation of the attractor points and includes the underlying control loop itself as subject to optimization. We incorporate optimality criteria such as e.g. the smoothness of the motion, collision distance measures, or joint limit avoidance. The optimization problem is solved efficiently employing the analytic equations of the overall system. Due to the fast convergence, the method is suited for dynamic environments, including the interaction with humans. We will present the details of the optimization scheme, and give a description of the chosen optimization criteria. Simulation and experimental results on the humanoid robot ASIMO will underline the potential of the proposed approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Full or partial loss of function in the upper limb is an increasingly common due to sports injuries, occupational injuries, spinal cord injuries, and strokes. Typically treatment for these conditions relies on manipulative physiotherapy procedures which are extremely labour intensive. Although mechanical assistive device exist for limbs this is rare for the upper body. In this paper we describe the construction and testing of a seven degree of motion prototype upper arm training/rehabilitation (exoskeleton) system. The total weight of the uncompensated orthosis is less than 2 kg. This low mass is primarily due to the use of a new range of pneumatic Muscle Actuators (pMA) as power source for the system. This type of actuator, which has also an excellent power/weight ratio, meets the need for safety, simplicity and lightness. The work presented shows how the system takes advantage of the inherent controllable compliance to produce a unit that is extremely powerful, providing a wide range of functionality (motion and forces over an extended range) in a manner that has high safety integrity for the patient. A training control scheme is introduced which is used to control the orthosis when used as exercise facility. Results demonstrate the potential of the device as an upper limb training, rehabilitation and power assist (exoskeleton) system.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As robots and humans move towards sharing the same environment, the need for safety in robotic systems is of growing importance. Towards this goal of human-friendly robotics, a robust, low-cost, low-noise capacitive force sensing array is presented with application as a whole body artificial skin covering. This highly scalable design provides excellent noise immunity, low-hysteresis, and has the potential to be made flexible and formable. Noise immunity is accomplished through the use of shielding and local sensor processing. A small and low-cost multivibrator circuit is replicated locally at each taxel, minimizing stray capacitance and noise coupling. Each circuit has a digital pulse train output, which allows robust signal transmission in noisy electrical environments. Wire count is minimized through serial or row-column addressing schemes, and the use of an open-drain output on each taxel allows hundreds of sensors to require only a single output wire. With a small set of interface wires, large arrays can be scanned hundreds of times per second and dynamic response remains flat over a broad frequency range. Sensor performance is evaluated on a bench-top version of a 4 × 4 taxel array in quasi-static and dynamic cases.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We describe localization-space trails (LOST), a method that enables a team of robots to navigate between places of interest in an initially unknown environment using a trail of landmarks. The landmarks are not physical; they are waypoint coordinates generated online by each robot and shared with teammates. Waypoints are specified in each robot's local coordinate system, and contain references to features in the world that are relevant to the team's task and common to all robots. Using these task-level references, robots can share waypoints without maintaining a global coordinate system. The method is tested in a series of real-world multirobot experiments. The results demonstrate that the method: 1) copes with accumulating odometry error; 2) is robust to the failure of individual robots; 3) converges to the best route discovered by any robot in the team. In one experiment, a team of four autonomous mobile robots performs a resource transportation task in our uninstrumented office building. Despite significant divergence of their local coordinate systems, the robots are able to share waypoints, forming and following a common trail between two predetermined locations for more than three hours, traveling a total of 8.2 km (5.1 miles) before running out of power. Designed to scale to large populations, LOST is fully distributed, with low costs in processing, memory, and bandwidth. It combines metric data about the position of features in the world with instructions on how to get from one place to another; producing something between a map and a plan.</td>

However, current implementations lack the robustness required to be useful outside laboratory conditions: blur, sudden motion and occlusion all cause tracking to fail and corrupt the map. Here we present a system which automatically detects and recovers from tracking failure while preserving map integrity. By extending recent advances in keypoint recognition the system can quickly resume tracking - i.e. within a single frame time of 33 ms - using any of the features previously stored in the map. Extensive tests show that the system can reliably generate maps for long sequences even in the presence of frequent tracking failure.</td>

This new framework provides new insights into two crucial issues in face recognition: feature extraction and robustness to occlusion. For feature extraction, we show that if sparsity in the recognition problem is properly harnessed, the choice of features is no longer critical. What is critical, however, is whether the number of features is sufficiently large and whether the sparse representation is correctly computed. Unconventional features such as downsampled images and random projections perform just as well as conventional features such as eigenfaces and Laplacianfaces, as long as the dimension of the feature space surpasses certain threshold, predicted by the theory of sparse representation. This framework can handle errors due to occlusion and corruption uniformly by exploiting the fact that these errors are often sparse with respect to the standard (pixel) basis. The theory of sparse representation helps predict how much occlusion the recognition algorithm can handle and how to choose the training images to maximize robustness to occlusion. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available databases to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and corroborate the above claims.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Skid-steered mobile robots are widely used because of their simple mechanism and high reliability. Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of such a robotic platform is, however, challenging due to the complex wheel/ground interactions and kinematic constraints. In this paper, we develop a kinematic modeling scheme to analyze the skid-steered mobile robot. Based on the analysis of the kinematics of the skid-steered mobile robot, we reveal the underlying geometric and kinematic relationships between the wheel slips and locations of the instantaneous rotation centers. As an application example, we also present how to utilize the modeling and analysis for robot positioning and wheel slip estimation using only low-cost strapdown inertial measurement units. The robot positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) design that incorporates the kinematic constraints for accuracy enhancement. The performance of the EKF-based positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme are also presented. The estimation methodology is tested and validated experimentally on a robotic test bed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Modular, self-reconfigurable robots show the promise of great versatility, robustness and low cost. The paper presents examples and issues in realizing those promises. PolyBot is a modular, self-reconfigurable system that is being used to explore the hardware reality of a robot with a large number of interchangeable modules. PolyBot has demonstrated the versatility promise, by implementing locomotion over a variety of terrain and manipulation versatility with a variety of objects. PolyBot is the first robot to demonstrate sequentially two topologically distinct locomotion modes by self-reconfiguration. PolyBot has raised issues regarding software scalability and hardware dependency and as the design evolves the issues of low cost and robustness will be resolved while exploring the potential of modular, self-reconfigurable robots</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Automated analysis of human affective behavior has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and related disciplines. However, the existing methods typically handle only deliberately displayed and exaggerated expressions of prototypical emotions despite the fact that deliberate behaviour differs in visual appearance, audio profile, and timing from spontaneously occurring behaviour. To address this problem, efforts to develop algorithms that can process naturally occurring human affective behaviour have recently emerged. Moreover, an increasing number of efforts are reported toward multimodal fusion for human affect analysis including audiovisual fusion, linguistic and paralinguistic fusion, and multi-cue visual fusion based on facial expressions, head movements, and body gestures. This paper introduces and surveys these recent advances. We first discuss human emotion perception from a psychological perspective. Next we examine available approaches to solving the problem of machine understanding of human affective behavior, and discuss important issues like the collection and availability of training and test data. We finally outline some of the scientific and engineering challenges to advancing human affect sensing technology.</td>
