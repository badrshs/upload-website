If the robot fails to recognize the object, then it We developed a landmark recognition system which is used asks the user for help. The user can interact with the robot by a humanoid robot to identify landmarks during its vocally via the robot’s speech recognition capability or by navigation. The humanoid landmark recognition system is using any other communication tool. In the autonomous based on a two-step classification stage which is robust and mode, the robot automatically detects the landmarks that invariant towards scaling and translations.

Object recognition in real scenes is one of the challenging problems in computer vision, as it is necessary I. INTRODUCTION to deal with difficulties such as viewpoint changes, Mobile robots have been widely used in various occlusions, illumination variations, background clutter, or application areas such as space missions, military sensor noise [3]. Furthermore, in a mobile robotics scenario operations, personal assistants to humans, cleaning, a new challenge is added to the list: computational entertainment, and tour guiding. The great variety of mobile complexity. All these complications make object recognition robots’ applications forces researchers to create and develop in real scenes a difficult problem that will demand a reliable and efficient robotics systems. Many key research significant research effort in the coming years. problems of mobile robot applications should be considered Object recognition in robot navigation is used to detect in the development of robot architecture design and modules and classify landmarks during navigation. It is also used to such as navigation, localization, vision-based recognition, localize the current position of the robot with respect to the speech recognition, and dialog processing [1]. On the other detected landmarks. This process is called the robot’s self hand, some human-robot interaction (HRI) mechanisms and localization. It is defined as the process of estimating the mobile robot navigation techniques should be incorporated initial position of the robot with respect to a global in many applications. HRI has been extensively studied by coordinate system or according to recognized landmarks. many research groups. It can be categorized as active and Landmark-based localization techniques are common in passive HRI [2]. In active HRI, a user actively interacts with robotics. They can be classified into active and passive a mobile robot via unnatural communication tools such as a landmarks. Active landmarks are captured and transmitted joystick or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In passive to the robot for sensing and analysis, such as images interaction, the robot enables the user to use more natural acquired by the robot’s cameras. Passive landmarks are interaction means such as speech or gestures. Therefore, the detected by the robot without any transmitted signals, such human user behaves naturally with the mobile robot, as if he as the output of a laser sensor [2]. were interacting with another person. In general, approaches to solving the recognition problem can be classified into two categories: appearance- 978-1-4244-2679-9/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 572<p></td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robot navigation is one of the basic problems in robotics. In general, the robot navigation algorithms are classified as global or local, depending on surrounding environment. In global navigation, the environment surrounding the robot is known and the path which avoids the obstacle is selected. In local navigation, the environment surrounding the robot is unknown, and sensors are used to detect the obstacles and avoid collision. In the past, a number of algorithms have been designed by many researchers for robot navigation problems. This paper presents software simulation of navigation problems of a mobile robot avoiding obstacles in a static environment using both classical and fuzzy based algorithms. The simulation environment is a menu-driven one where one can draw obstacles of standard shapes and sizes and assign the starting and ending points of the mobile robot. The robot will then navigate among these obstacles without hitting them and reach the specified goal point.</td>

All the above detectors can be generalized as the so-called acceleration Some indoor navigation systems require additional moving variance detector, the acceleration magnitude infrastructure such as infrared, ultrasound, wireless fidelity detector, the angular rate energy (ARE) detector which are (WIFI), ultra wide band (UWB) and vision [2],[3].

Since the early days of mobile robotics real-world position of the mobile robot. localization research vision-based method, among others, has been one of the techniques being explored by researchers. Vision sensors are one of the most versatile as they can be used in many environments such as indoor, outdoor and even in underwater applications [1]. They can provide useful image information about detected shape or color in their field of view. This information is particularly useful for helping the mobile robot localize. Therefore, the authors propose a localization method of identifying each mobile robot and obtaining its relative position and heading direction in the limited filed using vision sensor. Two important papers [2], [3] provide a good survey of various aspects of the progress made so far in vision based navigation and localization methods. Unfortunately, vision based localization requires complex algorithms and high quality hardware resources when related to general environment features. However, using simple landmarks can reduce dramatically the cost and the Fig. 1. (A) Illustration of how the camera should be placed in real complexity of the recognition system.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: Precise navigation is a key capability of autonomous mobile robots and required for many tasks including transportation or docking. To guarantee a robust and accurate localization and navigation performance, many practical approaches rely on observations of artificial landmarks. This raises the question of where to place the landmarks along the desired trajectory of the robot. In this paper, we present a novel approach to landmark selection, which aims at selecting the minimal set of landmarks that bounds the uncertainty about the deviation of the robot from its desired trajectory. At the same time the selected landmark sets are robust against the fact that a certain number of landmarks can be obscured from view during operation. Our algorithm is highly efficient due to a linearization of the whole navigation cycle and employs submodular optimization, for which strong formal bounds on the approximation quality are known. In extensive experiments, also carried out with a real robot, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several other methods and that it enables robust autonomous robot navigation in practice.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mobile robot vision-based navigation has been the source of countless research contributions, from the domains of both vision and control. Vision is becoming more and more common in applications such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation, path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection. This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept of visual sonar has also been revised.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract As robots tend to establish their presence in every day human environments the necessity for them to attain socially acceptable behavior is a condition sine qua non. Consequently, robots need to learn and react appropriately, should they be able to share the same space with people and to reconcile their operation to man’s activity. This work proposes an integrated robot framework that allows navigation in a human populated environment. This is the first work that employs the performed actions of individuals so as to re-plan and design a collision-free and at the same time a socially acceptable trajectory. Expandability is another feature of the suggested mapping module since it is capable of incorporating an unconstrained number of actions and subsequently responses, according to the needs of the task in hand and the environment in which the robot operates. Moreover, the paper addresses the integration of the proposed mapping module with the rest of the robot framework in order to operate in a seamless fashion. The generic design of this architecture allows the replacement of modules with other similar ones, thus providing adaptability with respect to the environment and so on. The method utilizes off-line constructed 3D metric maps organized in terms of a topological graph. During its perambulation the robot is ample to detect humans while it exploits deep learning strategies to recognize their activities. The memorized actions are seamlessly associated with specific rules –deriving from the proxemics theory– and are organized in an efficient manner to be recalled during robot’s navigation. Moreover, the paper exhibits the differences of the robot navigation in inhabited and uninhabited environments and demonstrates the alteration of the robot’s trajectory with respect to the recognized actions and poses of the individuals. The system has been evaluated on a robot able to acquire RGB-D data in domestic environments. The human detection and the action recognition modules exhibited remarkable performance, the human detection one was flawless about its decision while the action recognition one confused actions regarding the number of individuals that participate in them. Last, the robot navigation component was proved capable of extracting safe trajectories in human populated environments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: This paper is about long-term navigation in environments whose appearance changes over time - suddenly or gradually. We describe, implement and validate an approach which allows us to incrementally learn a model whose complexity varies naturally in accordance with variation of scene appearance. It allows us to leverage the state of the art in pose estimation to build over many runs, a world model of sufficient richness to allow simple localisation despite a large variation in conditions. As our robot repeatedly traverses its workspace, it accumulates distinct visual experiences that in concert, implicitly represent the scene variation - each experience captures a visual mode. When operating in a previously visited area, we continually try to localise in these previous experiences while simultaneously running an independent vision based pose estimation system. Failure to localise in a sufficient number of prior experiences indicates an insufficient model of the workspace and instigates the laying down of the live image sequence as a new distinct experience. In this way, over time we can capture the typical time varying appearance of an environment and the number of experiences required tends to a constant. Although we focus on vision as a primary sensor throughout, the ideas we present here are equally applicable to other sensor modalities. We demonstrate our approach working on a road vehicle operating over a three month period at different times of day, in different weather and lighting conditions. In all, we process over 136,000 frames captured from 37km of driving.</td>

In this paper, we present a new method to decide the op- timal robot’s motion with a quadruped robot of Sony Legged Robots League. The method keeps the “observational cost” as small as possible. The task we cope with is navigation. The robot can reach the destination rapidly and robustly with this method in spite of under the unfavorable conditions such as restricted sensor ability, limited CPU power, and in- accurate locomotion. Finally the eﬃciency of our method is veriﬁed by experiments. 1 Introduction On the soccer ﬁeld, the robot’s decision mainly depends on its location. There are many researches about localization[1, 2, 3]. However, the task which should be ﬁnally accomplished is not to localize accurately, but to decide the optimal motion. There are two researches which provide eﬀective motion decisions with sim- ple observations under the condition of Sony Legged Robots League[4, 5]. In these researches, the robot decides its motion according to the appearance of the landmarks and the ball. However, the relations between the location and the decision are designed arbitrarily. Therefore, the optimality of the decision is not guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a method to decide the optimal motion with the smallest observational cost. The task we cope with is navigation. This is a task to make a robot reach a target position and orientation which has some allowance called “target region”. This task is applicatory to other tasks such as occupying a defensive position. In addition, we can evaluate the optimality by the time to reach the target region. In this research, we use ERS-1100 that is the unique hardware in Sony Legged Robot League. Following characteristics of ERS-1100 make the task diﬃcult. – Restricted sensor ability: Insuﬃcient information due to the narrow ﬁeld of view – Limited CPU power: A calculation that needs high CPU power is not exe- cutable.

For each component, we have further subdivided our treatment of the subject on the basis of structured and unstructured environments. For indoor robots in structured environments, we have dealt separately with the cases of geometrical and topological models of space. For unstructured environments, we have discussed the cases of navigation using optical flows, using methods from the appearance-based paradigm, and by recognition of specific objects in the environment.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract—The simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while si- multaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. Starting from the estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem developed in [1]–[3], this paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. This paper also describes a substantial imple- mentation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave (MMW) radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, this paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.</td>

Several simulated experiments of Markovian state transition demonstrate that QiRL is more robust to learning rates and initial states than traditional reinforcement learning. The QiRL approach is then applied to navigation control of a real mobile robot, and the simulated and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract In the past decade, a large number of robots has been built that explicitly implement biological navigation behaviours. We review these biomimetic approaches using a framework that allows for a common description of biological and technical navigation behaviour. The review shows that biomimetic systems make significant contributions to two fields of research: First, they provide a real world test of models of biological navigation behaviour; second, they make new navigation mechanisms available for technical applications, most notably in the field of indoor robot navigation. While simpler insect navigation behaviours have been implemented quite successfully, the more complicated way-finding capabilities of vertebrates still pose a challenge to current systems</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: This work introduces a novel control strategy to allow a class of mobile robots to robustly navigate in dynamics and potentially cluttered environments. The proposed approach combines a high-level motion planner and a low-level stabilizing feedback control law designed considering the nonlinear dynamic model of the vehicle. Taking advantage of a symbolic description of the vehicle dynamics and of the environment, the reference trajectories are sequences of elementary primitives which are obtained with a reduced computational cost. However, the resulting references may fail to be functionally controllable for the actual dynamical model of the vehicle. Accordingly, to obtain a desired tracking error, sufficient conditions are then derived by investigating the interconnection between the discrete time planner and the continuous time closed-loop nonlinear system. The effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated by considering, as application, a ground robot navigating in a cluttered environment.</td>

Among the various methods, we focus on the navigation method by using the geometric analysis with a laser scanner having the high resolution. When the robot turns around the obstacle, our proposed navigation method supplies the robot with the turning point for avoiding the obstacle and moving on the shortest path. At the same time, the next heading velocity is generated for the robot to have the maximum velocity by using the distance between the current position of the robot and the turning point. The robot executes the navigation in the unknown workspace which the various obstacles are randomly located. As the experimental results, we obtain the shortest path of the robot regardless of the obstacle's shape in the unknown environment.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract— We propose a method for evaluating the localiza- tion accuracy of an indoor navigation system in arbitrarily large environments. Instead of using externally mounted sensors, as required by most ground-truth systems, our approach involves mounting only landmarks consisting of distinct patterns printed on inexpensive foam boards. A pose estimation algorithm computes the pose of the robot with respect to the land- mark using the image obtained by an on-board camera. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of providing accurate estimates of a mobile robot’s position and orientation with respect to the landmarks in arbitrarily-sized environments over arbitrarily-long trials. Furthermore, because the approach involves minimal outfitting of the environment, we show that only a small amount of setup time is needed to apply the method to a new environment. Experiments involving a state-of-the-art navigation system demonstrate the ability of the method to facilitate accurate localization measurements over arbitrarily long periods of time.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: In an environment where a large number of networked robots are actively providing service, the navigation control and synchronization between the robots become a very important factor in terms of time it takes for the robots to complete tasks they are given especially in physically large-scale areas. The large-scale environment needs to be divided into multiple cells, each of which covers a specific area within the service area to ensure a proper communication link with robots. Using a relay functionality of the each cell, a centralized system can seamlessly control robots navigation. We assume that the path information for robots, called as segment in this paper, is given from a separate path planning system. The path is divided into two types: one without deadline constraint and one with deadline constraint. Due to randomness of events that prevent uninterrupted navigation, the robots can rarely navigate to the target position with a uniform speed. This severely affects the path planning system for choosing the most optimal robot and for planning a path for it while attempting to meet the service deadline constraints. In this paper, we make an attempt to minimize (1) the difference between the actual navigation time and the time that the system identifies, (2) the difference between the deadline to complete a segment and the time that the robot navigates the segment through, and (3) to seamlessly navigate robots from one cell to another.</td>

In the last years human–robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.</td>

Urban areas, how- ever, introduce numerous challenges for autonomous robots as they are rather unstructured and dynamic. In this paper, we present a navigation system for mobile robots designed to operate in crowded city environments and pedestrian zones. We describe the different com- ponents of this system including a SLAM module for dealing with huge maps of city centers, a planning component for inferring feasible paths taking also into account the traversability and type of terrain, a module for accurate localization in dynamic environments, and means for calibrating and monitoring the platform. Our navigation system has been implemented and tested in several large-scale field tests, in which a real robot autonomously navigated over several kilometers in a complex urban environment. This also included a public demon- stration, during which the robot autonomously traveled along a more than three kilometer long route through the city center of Freiburg, Germany.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The work presented in this paper deals with the problem of the navigation of a mobile robot either in unknown indoor environment or in a partially known one. A navigation method in an unknown environment based on the combination of elementary behaviors has been developed. Most of these behaviors are achieved by means of fuzzy inference systems. The proposed navigator combines two types of obstacle avoidance behaviors, one for the convex obstacles and one for the concave ones. The use of zero-order Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference systems to generate the elementary behaviors such as “reaching the middle of the collision-free space” and “wall-following” is quite simple and natural. However, one can always fear that the rules deduced from a simple human expertise are more or less sub-optimal. This is why we have tried to obtain these rules automatically. A technique based on a back-propagation-like algorithm is used which permits the on-line optimization of the parameters of a fuzzy inference system, through the minimization of a cost function. This last point is particularly important in order to extract a set of rules from the experimental data without having recourse to any empirical approach. In the case of a partially known environment, a hybrid method is used in order to exploit the advantages of global and local navigation strategies. The coordination of these strategies is based on a fuzzy inference system by an on-line comparison between the real scene and a memorized one. The planning of the itinerary is done by visibility graph and A∗ algorithm. Fuzzy controllers are achieved, on the one hand, for the following of the planned path by the virtual robot in the theoretical environment and, on the other hand, for the navigation of the real robot when the real environment is locally identical to the memorized one. Both the methods have been implemented on the miniature mobile robot Khepera® that is equipped with rough sensors. The good results obtained illustrate the robustness of a fuzzy logic approach with regard to sensor imperfections. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research domain due to its extensive applications. The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: The challenge of persistent appearance-based navigation and mapping is to develop an autonomous robotic vision system that can simultaneously localize, map and navigate over the lifetime of the robot. However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods typically scale not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform; also, repeated revisits to locations will develop multiple competing representations which reduce recall performance. In this paper we present a solution to the persistent localization, mapping and global path planning problem in the context of a delivery robot in an office environment over a one-week period. Using a graphical appearance-based SLAM algorithm, CAT-Graph, we demonstrate constant time and memory loop closure detection with minimal degradation during repeated revisits to locations, along with topological path planning that improves over time without using a global metric representation. We compare the localization performance of CAT-Graph to openFABMAP, an appearance-only SLAM algorithm, and the path planning performance to occupancy-grid based metric SLAM. We discuss the limitations of the algorithm with regard to environment change over time and illustrate how the topological graph representation can be coupled with local movement behaviors for persistent autonomous robot navigation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract This chapter provides a review of techniques related to navigation of unmanned vehicles through unknown environments cluttered with obstacles, especially those that rigorously ensure collision avoidance (given certain assumptions about the system). This topic continues to be an active area of research, and we highlight some directions in which available approaches may be improved. The chapter discusses models of the sensors and vehicle kinematics, as well as assumptions about the environment and performance criteria. Methods applicable to stationary obstacles, moving obstacles, and scenarios with multiple vehicles are covered. In preference to global approaches based on full knowledge of the environment, particular attention is given to reactive methods based on only local sensory data, with a special focus on recently proposed navigation laws based on the sliding mode and model predictive control.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract This chapter discusses the problem of reactively navigating a Dubins-car like robot along an equidistant curve of an environmental object or, otherwise stated, following the boundary of this object with a predefined range margin. Two sensing scenarios are considered. In one of them, navigation is based on access to the distance to the nearest point of the boundary. The other scenario assumes the distance to the boundary is measured perpendicularly to the robot’s centerline, and the angle of incidence of this perpendicular to the boundary is also accessible. For both scenarios, reactive sliding mode control laws are proposed that drive the robot at a prespecified distance from the boundary and thereafter maintain this distance. Mathematically rigorous analysis of the proposed control laws is provided. Computer simulations and experiments with real-wheeled robots confirm the applicability and performance of the proposed guidance approach. </td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: This paper is about extending the reach and endurance of outdoor localisation using stereo vision. At the heart of the localisation is the fundamental task of discovering feature correspondences between recorded and live images. One aspect of this problem involves deciding where to look for correspondences in an image and the second is deciding what to look for. This latter point, which is the main focus of our paper, requires understanding how and why the appearance of visual features can change over time. In particular, such knowledge allows us to better deal with abrupt and challenging changes in lighting. We show how by instantiating a parallel image processing stream which operates on illumination-invariant images, we can substantially improve the performance of an outdoor visual navigation system. We will demonstrate, explain and analyse the effect of the RGB to illumination-invariant transformation and suggest that for little cost it becomes a viable tool for those concerned with having robots operate for long periods outdoors.</td>

The main novelty of the proposed framework is that the vehicle is assumed to be totally blind, namely the obstacles cannot be sensed a priori. Therefore, the presence of possible accidental contacts with the surrounding environment has to be taken into account. To maintain stability in such a complex scenario, mechanics, and control are co-designed. The proposed control strategy relies on some mechanical properties of the airframe, namely on the relative position of the contact points and of the onboard actuators, and on the design of a supervisor able to detect the presence of a contact only by observing the behavior of the flight control loop. The effectiveness of the obtained results is then demonstrated using experiments conducted on a ducted-fan prototype.</td>

The implementation includes map building, path planning, localization, local path planning and obstacle avoidance, and path tracking. ICP(Iterative closest point) is employed to build grid based map using scanned range data. Dijkstra algorithm plans path from an initial location to a goal position. Particle filter estimates the robot position and orientation using the scanned range data. Elastic force is used for local path planning and obstacle avoidance towards a goal position. The algorithms are combined for autonomous navigation in a work area of 100m x 40m, which comprises rooms, corridors, obstacles like passers-by, and many furniture and exhibition area. The robot ran at the maximum speed of l.0 m/sec, and passed all the way points and reached to goal location through the path of the length 165m in 255 seconds, with the average speed of O.65m/sec.</td>

We propose a solution based on our pre- vious work in fast constrained motion planning, where arbitrary mobility constraints could be satisfied while the planning problem is reduced to unconstrained heuristic search in state lattices. By trading off optimality, we improve planner run-times and increase robustness through achieving anytime planning quality, such that it becomes possible to integrate the planner within the high speed navigation framework. We show that using a planner in navigation works well and fast enough for real vehicle implementation, while it presents a number of important benefits over state-of-the-art in navigation.

Here the terrain model is not a priori known, but the robot is equipped with a sensor system (vision or touch) employed for the purpose of navigation. Our focus is restricted to the non-heuristic algorithms which can be theoretically shown to be correct within a given framework of models for the robot, terrain and sensor system. These formulations, although abstract and sim- pli ed compared to real-life scenarios, provide foundations for practical systems by highlighting the underlying critical issues. First, we consider the algorithms that are shown to navigate correctly without much consideration given to the performance parameters such as distance traversed, etc. Second, we consider non-heuristic algo- rithms that guarantee bounds on the distance traversed or the ratio of the distance traversed to the shortest path length (computed if the terrain model is known). Then we consider the navigation of robots with very limited computational capabilities such as nite automata, etc.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to the problem of planning the motion of a mobile robot in extended uncertain environments. All knowledge of the environment has been acquired by the robot during the current (or a previous) operation, such that the environment description reflects the accumulated error of the robot's pose during periods of dead-reckoning navigation. In this uncertain environment, the robot searches for trajectories that maximize the probability of attaining a desired target region. For that purpose we identify a discrete set of robot positions in order to construct a routing graph, whose arcs represent the probability of reaching a new position. In that way the search for an optimal trajectory is solved by searching for a minimum weight path in a routing graph. The method is based on a probabilistic model of all the errors/uncertainties affecting the reliability of the planned trajectory.</td>

In the presence of obstacles, uncertainty and incomplete information Multi-Robot system is used to accomplish the task in more efficient way as compared to single robot system. Navigation of robots in its surrounding is essential to avoid unacceptable situation such as avoiding obstacles, trajectory planning. Cooperative behavior of multi-robots provides efficient way to avoid collision. It is a matter of concern that how a group of mobile robots should be controlled so that they can move in a cohesive way toward a single direction. For the problem of cooperation among robots, flocking strategy is a good solution. To learn cooperation among robots, various machine learning strategies have been developed. One of the machine learning techniques is called reinforcement learning. It is a very challenging issue in the area of robotics and artificial intelligence. Combining cooperative and learning strategy collision avoidance can be improved. Survey of multi-agent reinforcement learning and flocking control is presented in this paper.</td>

This paper presents a design of mobile robot control architecture and a survey about the navigation control method. An environmental model of mobile robots is built with an improved Voronoi Diagram method. This method embodies the network structure of the environment-free area with fewer nodes, so the complexity of path planning is reduced largely. Hybrid navigation strategy composed of deliberative planning and local optimization in unknown environment is studied. An improved D algorithm for deliberative planning in complex situation is proposed for avoiding local minima trap through searching a path from leave point.

Mobile robots need to have the capabilities of autonomy and intelligence, and they pose a challenge to researchers, which is to design algorithms that allow the robots to function autonomously in unstructured, dynamic, partially observable, and uncertain environments [1]. Navigation is the key to the relative technologies of mobile robots and neural networks are widely used in the field of mobile robot navigation due to their prop- erties such as nonlinear mapping, ability to learn from examples, good generalization performance, massively parallel processing, and capability to approximate an arbitrary function given sufficient number of neurons.
