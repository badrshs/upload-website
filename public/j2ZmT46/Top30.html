	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robotic swarms that take inspiration from nature are becoming a fascinating topic for multi-robot researchers. The aim is to control a large number of simple robots in order to solve common complex tasks. Due to the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms, current research in swarm robotics is mostly performed by simulation software. The simulation of large numbers of these robots in robotic swarm applications is extremely complex and often inaccurate due to the poor modelling of external conditions. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost, open-platform, autonomous micro-robot (Colias) for robotic swarm applications. Colias employs a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. It has a maximum speed of 35 cm/s which enables it to be used in swarm scenarios very quickly over large arenas. Long-range infrared modules with an adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours at a range of 0.5 cm to 2 m. Colias has been designed as a complete platform with supporting software development tools for robotics education and research. It has been tested in both individual and swarm scenarios, and the observed results demonstrate its feasibility for use as a micro-sized mobile robot and as a low-cost platform for robot swarm applications.</td>

This algorithm determines both the correspondence between observed landmarks (in this case vertical edges in the environment) and a stored map, and computes the location of the robot using those correspondences. The primary advantages of this algorithm are its use of a single geometric tolerance to describe observation error, its ability to recognize ambiguous sets of correspondences, its ability to compute bounds on the error in localization, and fast execution. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on a mobile robot system. In several hundred trials it has never failed, and computes location accurate to within a centimeter in less than 0.5 s</td>

Error models for the inertial sensors are generated and included in an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimating the position and orientation of a moving robot vehicle. Two different solid-state gyroscopes have been evaluated for estimating the orientation of the robot. Performance of the gyroscopes with error models is compared to the performance when the error models are excluded from the system. Similar error models have been developed for each axis of a solid-state triaxial accelerometer and for a conducting-bubble tilt sensor which may also be used as a low-cost accelerometer. An integrated inertial platform consisting of three gyroscopes, a triaxial accelerometer and two tilt sensors is described</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The amplitude response of infrared (IR) sensors based on reflected amplitude of the surrounding objects is non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. As a result, the main use of IR sensors in robotics is for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, their inherently fast response is very attractive for enhancing the real-time operation of a mobile robot in, for instance, map building tasks. Thus, it seems that the development of new low-cost IR sensors able to accurately measure distances with reduced response times is worth researching. In this paper, a new IR sensor based on the light intensity back-scattered from objects and able to measure distances of up to 1 m is described. Also, the sensor model is described and the expected errors in distance estimates are analysed and modelled. Finally, the experimental results obtained are discussed.</td>

The objective of the trajectory-generation algorithm is to optimise a cost function out to a limited time horizon. The space of control trajectories is searched by expanding a tree using randomised sampling, in a manner similar to an RRT. The algorithm is improved by seeding the tree using the best control trajectory from the previous iteration, and by pruning branches based on a bound to the cost function and the best trajectory found so far. Performance of the algorithm is analysed in simulation. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented on two kinds of vehicles: the Segway RMP and a four-wheel-drive. The algorithm has been used to drive autonomously for a combined total on the order of hundreds of hours.</td>

In this work, we present the design of a robot arm and data from experiments to characterize the accuracy and resolution of the force sensing. We describe a force-following manipulation experiment using two robots. The experiment measures strain on a rigid bar between two robots. The data shows the feasibility of using SEAs for force sensing to reduce the strain in the bar. This is the first step towards a distributed force controller for multi robot object coordination with large numbers of robots.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new method for improving the accuracy of inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on land vehicles. The algorithm exploits nonholonomic constraints that govern the motion of a vehicle on a surface to obtain velocity observation measurements which aid in the estimation of the alignment of the IMU as well as the forward velocity of the vehicle. It is shown that this can be achieved without any external sensing provided that certain observability conditions are met. A theoretical analysis is provided together with a comparison of experimental results between a nonlinear implementation of the algorithm and an IMU/GPS navigation system. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm. The real time implementation is also addressed through a multiple observation inertial aiding algorithm based on the information filter. The results show that the use of these constraints and vehicle speed guarantees the observability of the velocity and the attitude of the inertial unit, and hence bounds the errors associated with these states. The strategies proposed provides a tighter navigation loop which can sustain outages of GPS for a greater amount of time as compared to when the inertial unit is used with standard integration algorithms</td>

Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization. A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an efficient localization scheme for an indoors mobile robot using Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems. The mobile robot carries an RFID reader at the bottom of the chassis, which reads the RFID tags on the floor to localize the mobile robot. Each of the RFID tags stores its own absolute position, which is used to calculate the position, orientation, and velocity of the mobile robot. However, a localization system based on RFID technology inevitably suffers from an estimation error. In this paper, a new triangular pattern of arranging the RFID tags on the floor has been proposed to reduce the estimation error of the conventional square pattern. In addition, the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot has been utilized to improve the localization accuracy of the mobile robot. According to the conventional approach, two readers are necessary to identify the orientation of the mobile robot. Therefore, this new approach, based on the motion-continuity property of the differential-driving mobile robot, provides a cheap and fast estimation of the orientation. The proposed algorithms used to raise the accuracy of the robot localization are successfully verified through experiments.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a novel randomized motion planner for robots that must achieve a specified goal under kinematic and/or dynamic motion constraints while avoiding collision with moving obstacles with known trajectories. The planner encodes the motion constraints on the robot with a control system and samples the robot's state × time space by picking control inputs at random and integrating its equations of motion. The result is a probabilistic roadmap of sampled state ×time points, called milestones, connected by short admissible trajectories. The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning query, it generates a new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal state×time point. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the state×time space satisfies a geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly idealized version of our implemented planner is guaranteed to find a trajectory when one exists, with probability quickly converging to 1, as the number of milestones increases. Our planner was tested extensively not only in simulated environments, but also on a real robot. In the latter case, a vision module estimates obstacle motions just before planning starts. The planner is then allocated a small, fixed amount of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the expected motion of the obstacles is detected while the robot executes the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes a trajectory on the fly. Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the planner in order to deal with time delays and uncertainties that are inherent to an integrated robotic system interacting with the physical world.</td>

To be able to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary for the robot to adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, and maintain its stability with a torso motion. When the ground conditions and stability constraint are satisfied, it is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. We first formulate the constraints of the foot motion parameters. By varying the values of the constraint parameters, we can produce different types of foot motion to adapt to ground conditions. We then propose a method for formulating the problem of the smooth hip motion with the largest stability margin using only two parameters, and derive the hip trajectory by iterative computation. Finally, the correlation between the actuator specifications and the walking patterns is described through simulation studies, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by simulation examples and experimental results</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstaclebased global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.</td>

A low-bandwidth tilt sensor is used along with an inaccurate rate gyro and a low-cost accelerometer to obtain the measurement. The rate gyro has an inherent bias along with sensor noise. The tilt sensor uses an internal pendulum and therefore has its own slow dynamics. These sensor dynamics were identified experimentally and combined to achieve high-bandwidth measurements using an optimal linear state estimator. Potential uses of the measurement technique range from robotics, to rehabilitation, to vehicle control.</td>

This prototype is designed to provide mobile robot swarms with advanced sensing capabilities in an efficient, cost-effective way. From the observation of bats' foraging behaviors, the prototype with a particular emphasis on variable rotation range and speed, as well as 360° observation capability has been developed. The prototype also aims at giving each robot reliable information about identification of neighboring robots from objects and their positions. For this purpose, an observation algorithm-based sensor is proposed. The implementation details are explained, and the effectiveness of the control schemes is verified through extensive experiments. The sensor provides real-time location of stationary targets positioned 100 cm away within an average error of 2.6 cm. Moreover, experimental results show that the prototype observation capability can be quite satisfactory for practical use of mobile robot swarms.</td>

A low-cost selective compliant articulated robotic arm designed for liquid spillage avoidance is developed here. In the vertical-plane robotic arm movement test, the signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and accelerometer were able to sense collisions. In the horizontal movement test, however, only the signals from the IMU enabled collision to be detected. Using a calculation method developed, it was possible to chart the regions where the obstacle was likely to be located when a collision occurred. The low cost of the IMU and its easy incorporation into the robotic arm offer the potential to meet the pressures of lowering operating costs, apply laboratory automation in resource-limited venues, and obviate human intervention in response to sudden disease outbreaks.</td>

First, we describe the design of a reactive navigation method that uses a "divide and conquer" strategy based on situations to simplify the difficulty of the navigation. Many techniques could be used to implement this design (since it is described at symbolic level), leading to new reactive methods that must be able to navigate in arduous environments (as the difficulty of the navigation is simplified). We also propose a geometry-based implementation of our design called the nearness diagram navigation. The advantage of this reactive method is to successfully move robots in troublesome scenarios, where other methods present a high degree of difficulty in navigating. We show experimental results on a real vehicle to validate this research, and a discussion about the advantages and limitations of this new approach.</td>

The system is based on time-of-flight evaluation of ultrasonic pulses and a RF communication link. The system has a precision of 8 mm and of 3deg over a 6.7 m range.

To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only $14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.</td>

This article presents a family of probabilistic localization algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). MCL algorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted hypotheses (samples), which approximate the posterior under a common Bayesian formulation of the localization problem. Building on the basic MCL algorithm, this article develops a more robust algorithm called Mixture-MCL, which integrates two complimentary ways of generating samples in the estimation. To apply this algorithm to mobile robots equipped with range finders, a kernel density tree is learned that permits fast sampling.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As robots and humans move towards sharing the same environment, the need for safety in robotic systems is of growing importance. Towards this goal of human-friendly robotics, a robust, low-cost, low-noise capacitive force sensing array is presented with application as a whole body artificial skin covering. This highly scalable design provides excellent noise immunity, low-hysteresis, and has the potential to be made flexible and formable. Noise immunity is accomplished through the use of shielding and local sensor processing. A small and low-cost multivibrator circuit is replicated locally at each taxel, minimizing stray capacitance and noise coupling. Each circuit has a digital pulse train output, which allows robust signal transmission in noisy electrical environments. Wire count is minimized through serial or row-column addressing schemes, and the use of an open-drain output on each taxel allows hundreds of sensors to require only a single output wire. With a small set of interface wires, large arrays can be scanned hundreds of times per second and dynamic response remains flat over a broad frequency range. Sensor performance is evaluated on a bench-top version of a 4 × 4 taxel array in quasi-static and dynamic cases.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new vision-based obstacle detection method for mobile robots. Each individual image pixel is classified as belonging either to an obstacle or the ground based on its color appearance. The method uses a single passive color camera, performs in real-time, and provides a binary obstacle image at high resolution. The system is easily trained by simply driving the robot through its environment. In the adaptive mode, the system keeps learning the appearance of the ground during operation. The system has been tested successfully in a variety of environments, indoors as well as outdoors.</td>

The robot is self-mobile, with three independently driven wheels that also serve as connectors. The new connectors can be automatically operated, and are based on stationary magnets coupled to mechanically actuated ferromagnetic yoke pieces. Extensive use is made of plastic castings, laser cut plastic sheets, and low-cost motors and electronic components. Modules interface with a host PC via Bluetooth® radio. An off-board camera, along with a set of modules and a control PC form a convenient, low-cost system for rapidly developing and testing control algorithms for modular reconfigurable robots. Experimental results demonstrate mechanical docking, connector strength, and accuracy of dead reckoning locomotion.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper concerns the development of robot skin capable of accurately sensing the location of objects in area contact with the skin surface. There has been no report on tactile sensing which attained not only skin deformation detection but also contact object location sensing with high accuracy. In the category of optomechatronics technology, we apply optical fibers to transmit surface deformation information of soft skin for sensing the location of an object in contact with the soft skin accurately. In the paper, we illustrate the structure of the robot skin, and describe the principle of both detecting the position of the reflector chips and sensing the contact location of an object. The robot skin is characterized by the fact that the surface is low cost and easily replacable, and the sensing performance is robust against any electromagnetic disturbance. We then show experimental results for verifying the principles using a wedge-shaped object. For evaluating the sensing accuracy, comparisons are made: 1) between the location of a real convex of the object and that of the corresponding estimated polygon and 2) for the position of two vertices of the object when independent fitting and Lagrangian fitting methods are applied.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: It is often important to obtain the real-time location of a small-sized ground robotic vehicle when it performs autonomous tasks either indoors or outdoors. We propose and implement LOBOT, a low-cost, self-contained localization system for small-sized ground robotic vehicles. LOBOT provides accurate real-time, 3D positions in both indoor and outdoor environments. Unlike other localization schemes, LOBOT does not require external reference facilities, expensive hardware, careful tuning or strict calibration, and is capable of operating under various indoor and outdoor environments. LOBOT identifies the local relative movement through a set of integrated inexpensive sensors and well corrects the localization drift by infrequent GPS-augmentation. Our empirical experiments in various temporal and spatial scales show that LOBOT keeps the positioning error well under an accepted threshold.</td>
