        <h2>Web Devlopment:What is the web?</h2>
     <p>In a nutshell, the web is a whole bunch of interconnected computers talking to one another. The computers (on the web) are typically connected by phone lines, digital satellite signals, cables, and other types of data-transfer mechanisms. A ‘data-transfer mechanism’ is a nerd’s way of saying: a way to move information from point A to point B to point C and so on.<br>

The computers that make up the web can be connected all the time (24/7), or they can be connected only periodically.<br> The computers that are connected all the time are typically called a ‘server’<br>. Servers are computers just like the one you’re using now to read this article, with one major difference, they have a special software installed called ‘server’ software.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Welcome to PHP.com</h2>
        <p>I created this website to teach PRACTICAL PHP to non-nerd web designer types. With the recent release of PHP7 in 2016, PHP continues to prove that it is a powerful programming language. You could say in fact, that PHP is one of the four pillars of modern web development:</p>
        <ul>
       
            <li>PHP</li> 
           
            <li>HTML</li>
             <li>CSS</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>PHP</h2>
        
        <p>Course Outcomes By end the end of this course, you'll have gained familiarity with a very convenient, flexible server-side language: PHP. <br>You'll be exposed to many fundamental programming concepts such as data types, functions, control flow, and more.<br>

Why learn PHP? PHP is one of the simplest server-side languages out there, and it was designed primarily for web development.<br> Learning PHP is good not only because it adds one more language to your toolbelt, but also because there is a large number of sites currently built with Wordpress, a content management system (CMS) built with PHP.</p>
