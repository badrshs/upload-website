				    <h2>About me</h2>
					<p>â€œMy name is Christine Bassem Berzi , and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience. People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent communication skills. I have had a variety of customer service opportunities, through which I was able to have fewer returned products and increased repeat customers, when compared with co-workers. I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player. I have worked in lead qualification, and telemarketing in the technology industry. My experience includes successfully calling people in director-level positions of technology departments and developing viable leads.
            </p>
			<h2>Values</h2>
					<p>HR taught me to deal with different types of people besides problem solving.
I find enjoyment in gaining knowledge as i don't get enough of learning about things.
            </p>
              <h3>Hobbies</h3>
			  <p>Love doing ordinary things in my own creative & untraditional way.
Seeking to gain more knowledge and experience in HR.
HR grew in me more of the Self Study and started to learn more about it through the internet.
