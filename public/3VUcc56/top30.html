	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: abstract Being able to navigate accurately is one of the fundamental capabilities of a mobile robot to effectively execute a variety of tasks including docking, transportation, and manipulation. As real-world environments often contain changing or ambiguous areas, existing features can be insufficient for mobile robots to establish a robust navigation behavior. A popular approach to overcome this problem and to achieve accurate localization is to use artificial landmarks. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimally placing such artificial landmarks for mobile robots that repeatedly have to carry out certain navigation tasks. Our method aims at finding the minimum number of landmarks for which a bound on the maximum deviation of the robot from its desired trajectory can be guaranteed with high confidence. The proposed approach incrementally places landmarks utilizing linearized versions of the system dynamics of the robot, thus allowing for an efficient computation of the deviation guarantee. We evaluate our approach in extensive experiments carried out both in simulations and with real robots. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches and is suitable for long-term operation of mobile robots.</td>

Vision is becoming more and more common in applications such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation, path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection. This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept of visual sonar has also been revised.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Autonomous navigation of a robot is a promising research domain due to its extensive applications. The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided.</td>

Disintegration of such environment into small areas, or regions shows impact on the quality of adaptive path planning in dynamic environment. Many algorithms are developed for solving problems involving narrow passages and multiple regions with optimal solution. Autonomous mobile robot system must have sense of balance of its potential, steadfastness and sturdiness issue with task and the final goals while generating and executing an adaptive as well as effective strategy with optimal solution. Navigation algorithms approaching to a certain maturity in the field of autonomous mobile robot, so most of research is now focused more advance task like adaptive path planning and navigation through dynamic environments. Adaptive path planning and navigation needs to set learning rate, rules for classifying spaces and defining proposed library parameters. The aim of this survey is to informing the progress of human sentient manipulation planner.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract— Frequently, robots find themselves asking this question. Knowing your location?? And being able to navigate to other locations is extremely important for autonomous robots. The act of finding one's location against a map is known as localization. So how can a robot localize itself? The most common form of intelligent localization and navigation is to use a map, combined with sensor readings and some form of closed-loop motion feedback. But a robot needs to do so much more than just localizing itself. Often, we’d like our robots to be able to build their own maps, since map building by hand is tedious, boring, and error-prone. The field of robotics that studies localization and mapping is typically called SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) [1]. Robot cists around the globe have been working to find a solution to localization for more than 20 years; however, only in the past 4-5 years we have seen some promising results. In this work, we describe a first-of-a-kind, breakthrough technology for pose finding for localization that requires only one low-cost camera and a powerful ARM based micro-controller. Because of its low-cost and robust performance in realistic environments, this technology is particularly well-suited for use in consumer and commercial applications.</td>

Keywords: Evolutionary Algorithm, Autonomous Navigation, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Simulation 1 Introduction The navigation problem in mobile robotics is the problem of making navigation decisions for one or more autonomous mobile robots, placed in an arbitrary environment, to accomplish certain predeﬁned tasks[5]. There are many aspects of this problem: environment settings, application peculiarities, robot characteristics, and task priorities. Many techniques such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary algorithms have been used in an attempt to solve this problem. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a computing strategy that solves diﬃcult optimization problems. EAs are inspired by biology, more speciﬁcally in the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. They abstract and mimic some of the traits of natural evolution to produce functional adaptive processes [1]. Genetic algorithms are intrinsically parallel because the search enables discovery of multiple solutions, and can control a population of robots that work simultaneously. This paper describes a genetic algorithm, where the population exists as actual robots that exchange genetic information in order to adapt to solve a particular problem. The goal is to train a robot to interact with an unknown environment. Our main contribution is a novel chromosome encoding for mobile robotics and also a simulator for this task.
